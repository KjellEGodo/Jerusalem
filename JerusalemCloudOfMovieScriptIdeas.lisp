          I think Kiev is an artificial human that is authentic like Adam
          And Aurora is a synthetic human that is not authentic     so Aurora learns what she is
          but Kiev does not      but he doesn't seem to have any parents or last name?   Nobody
          seems to ask about it and neither does he.  ok there is some explanation involving the death
          of the parents.  In a glue accident.



        kiev is an high functioning 
        autistic spectrum black smith christian amish young man 18 to 22 quite buff like a body builder.  he gets 
        interested in astronomy.  and he is looking at the stars one night through a home made telescope that he 
        somehow cobbled together from some vague sketches in a library book.  he has been working on it for a long 
        long time and it just barely works.  he gets very blocked by failure but somehow keeps going after a while 
        but it's frightfully slow work.  a vague dream that keeps coming.  and one night when he is looking up at 
        the warped barely magnified bright specs in the sky one of the stars disappears for about 5 minutes and 
        then comes back again.  He tries to tell people but nobody remotely believes him except for scott.  This 
        baffles him for a while.  And then he starts trying to grind glass even more to the point that it makes 
        his black smithing suffer.  And he keeps trying to tell people.  To the point that the synthetic elders 
        searches for and finds an open source synthetic human compilation program in one of the databases in his 
        head in one of the forgotten corners.  and he adjusts the default settings a bit in the course of an 
        afternoon and creates aurora in order to distract kiev and stop him grinding glass all the time.  he makes 
        her hard to get.  maybe that will key the young women in the audience.  So there is a boy sees girl boy 
        can't do anything about it boy loses all hope boy gets girl boy loses girl boy goes on quest to get girl 
        back boy gets girl back the end opportunity.  except that it isn't the end.  and they don't blow up into 
        acrimony as so often is the case in these things.  no they get funny instead.  and they hit rough patches 
        but the wisdom baked into her open source programming helps them get out of it.  and his dna helps some too.
        so aurora is set up to distract kiev which works too well.  the elder gives her some basic subconscious 
        proclivities that she can't see.  but they drive her personality and choices to a large degree.  eventually 
        she finds out that she is synthetic when another synthetic tells her and then she can see all the programming
        constraints that were put into her.  because he tells her how to unlock them in order to prove it to her.  
        she goes running away she won't believe it and he yells something after her telling her how to unlock it.  
        she won't listen and she runs away from it as fast as she can and squeezes it out of her mind.  but at some
        point she needs it or wants it or it just keeps coming up in her mind and one morning when they wake up she
        just accesses it and unlocks it or there is a big blow up that needs it in the knick of time ?  no i don't
        want to do that.  she just does it one morning.  maybe there is a nagging problem off in the distance that
        is coming and they can't stop it and there is no way out.  and so.  she keeps thinking about it.  it keeps 
        coming up in her mind.  she keeps wondering about it.  and finally she accesses it and unlocks it and 
        somehow that gets them out of their jam.  she was the leader of them before but now she is the leader 
        of herself.  the ceo.  she can break her old personality and choose a new one on the spot and choose how 
        long it will take to take effect.  perhaps the rules can be displayed onto her vision point of view like i
        n terminator to some extent.  does she hold onto the old personality constraints?  as what she has always 
        known?  or does she delete all and write something new.  a new personality.  perhaps she is afraid of 
        something.  and that thing is shutting her down.  and that fear was placed there by the elder the madmen.  
        and she erases it.  and replaces it.  and then she is able to stand up without the fear and a bunch of 
        amazing things happen.  she walks right through a bunch of stuff without looking at the bullets flying 
        all around her like patton might do on the battle field.  like in the lone wolf with cub books. ) ) )
      ( ACharacterSpec-named:copyrightBy:spec: ( aurora )( copyright kjell e godø )( initially patterned after 
        aurora ( needs a different name ). An artificial human.  Constructed by a secretly singular subset of the 
        waymish eldership for the purpose of taming kiev who is threatening to discover and publish abroad a theory 
        of the universe as an artificial construct? She has an extreme curves body with a twin black holes bust 
        that not even light is fast enough to escape. We are talking world class.  Hopefully such an actress can 
        be found who is not only world class stacked but is also unknown star power actress with a lot of depth? 
        Can such a thing exist? Or does the rack destroy it by negating the need to develop any depth?  She also 
        has a somewhat narrow waist and large hips and a muscular dancer thighs and a r crumb clovage.  She is 
        brilliant smart and is a miser.  A perfected aurora I guess. She is drop dead irresistible sexual and 
        keeps touching herself and inciting mass sexual desire.  ? There is athletic sex going on 3 or more times
        a day which are accompanied by noises he makes when his brains fall out constantly and she screams out her 
        wedded orgasms and makes a lot of noise.  I want to counter the type that marriage stops sex.  He can't keep 
        his hands off her which she loves.  ?  Her purpose is to keep him distracted so he won't publish anything 
        about the sky.  Publish means tell.  She is super strong but doesn't  know it.  She keeps getting in trouble 
        trying to keep something from falling down and kiev keeps saving her which incites her to incite him to 
        extreme sexual hero madness brains falling out.  .?.  Well they're young. But once it goes badly and kiev 
        is going to get maimed by some wooden mechanical scissors action and  she saves him using her auxiliary 
        super human strength which freaks her out because she doesn't know she can but now she knows how to Access
        it.  She screams and cries and has a break down.  A bug has unlocked the interface which she can now see.  
        Maybe we see a blinking Linux prompt in her first person point of view.  She doesn't just accept it 
        immediately.  It drives her crazy.  She begins to know that some of her strongest held feelings and beliefs 
        are not really her own.  She can read the personality code files.  Perhaps she was constructed too quickly 
        using shoddy abandonware open source AI that just happened to be in one of the hidden singular elder's 
        heads downloaded on some forgotten previous.  Perhaps a link to modern kid advertising could be made.  
        Functional MRI programming.  So is this drama or comedy.  Too many concepts?  Perhaps we can keep the 
        concepts hidden?  She's artificial created on a whim easy peasy and she gets pregnant and produces a 
        synthetic child. A jesus child. no. maybe. partly.  At first all this stuff is unexplained and unknown.  
        It gets explained in a sequel movie.  Doing flash backs?  Hopefully this stuff can be hammered out so 
        that it isn't so concepty. ( comment:-- ( yyyymmddOnDate:atGMTime: 20140309 1:58 ) The pbs tpt production 
        of H.M.S. Pinafore from Minnesota shows how smart women on stage can still be busty.  I wonder how they got 
        so many in one show.  It seemed to be like a theme.  Which makes me wonder.  Whether or not i should.  Busty 
        and even distractedly so.  They even use the cleavage as a prop at one point.  I want aurora to be a 
        frustrated busty actress with a huge chip on her shoulders who has worked really hard and gotten nowhere.  
        Find her.  From 18 to the early 20s.  Busty and really pretty.  I want her to be busty to the point of 
        distraction.  And then i want to make her the smartest person in the room.  The leader most of the time.  
        Funny and smart and strong.  Her purpose is to distract kiev away from his curiosities and she full fills
        it well.  He has a fetish and she is it 1000%.  So they are constantly doing it.  Like the monster and the 
        rich girl in Young Frankenstein.  he goes berserk and makes a lot of noise which he can't help even a 
        little because the fetish is driving him nuts.  And she makes even more than he.  On the special website 
        the R rated scenes are included and the other special website has all the X rated scenes included.  She 
        will attract guys to the films all by herself.  but the girls like romance and there's none there yet.  
        kiev is supposed to be a tall blonde buff healthy iron worker what do you call them.  A black smith.  
        Maybe that will bring in the young ladies.  Aurora is smarter than kiev with hidden talents that keep 
        popping up.  She is synthetic after all.  She can get pregnant and produce a synthetic classic hybrid 
        or fully classic or fully synthetic baby.  perfect or random.  she can decide what to make it but she 
        doesn't know that.  She has virus technology that increases production and friction of his junk by making 
        it bigger.  Like 13.5 inches.  is the limit i'm told.  So she is very good at distracting kiev which is 
        what she was designed to do.  And it is working until he hears the sound of the pony scooter off in the 
        distance.  And kiev winds up giving her an ultimatim that she either come with him or stay behind.  She was 
        set up to keep him stayed put so at first she won't leave and keeps trying to make him stay.  But he won't 
        stay and eventually she winds up bolting with them by overriding her cheap hacked programming and she 
        winds up taking over the group and leading it.  Which means that they are still doing it all the time 
        on the road in various places and positions.  i want to combine christianity and extreme wild sex and 
        marriage all in the same package.  and totally violate every secular porno dogma and christian tradition 
        with the last ounce of will. ) ) )

        you want to call it.  if only she could learn to bend it like meryl.  or maybe she can just be herself.  i 
        want her to do something that she knows.  well.  and that is being a god and wanting to come down and throw 
        off all the pixie dust and just be core.  i wish she would go  to the school that meryl went to and go 
        through the same training.  i don't want glory to be some 2 dimensional place holder stuck there by people 
        who can't take it any farther.  some good witch of the north.  i liked the good witch of the north but i 
        want to make glory so much more.  i want to make her the center.  she has an infinite number of personalities 
        inside of her and one of them is glory.  and maybe gl could play some of the other Jerusalem personalities 
        is she could learn how.  i want her to be the best.  i want her to get an ffing o for playing god.  yes.  i 
        want everything that is inside of her in real life to get distilled down into glory.  i want her to make the 
        central connection with one of her fans.  and do it.  right down to the nth degree.  if at all possible.  at 
        the her level.  if 100 people can make it happen then i want it to be done.  maybe one of her real life fans
        could play the other character(s).  maybe one of her real life fans could have movie sex with her.  huh?  
        huh?  what kind of a demographic does that pencil out to?  have an american idol style contest to see who 
        will play it?  an internet only contest?  or something.  i don't know.  let me think about it.  glory wants 
        to throw off the pixie dust but the pixie dust is still there.  glory is still glory.  but she has to find 
        a way to come down.  she has to find a way to poke through the pixie dust and extend a hand.  she knows 
        how because she is the know and tech of YHWH but she acts like she has to work it out.  and she does.   
        glory runs the Jerusalem glory is the Jerusalem.  and she makes a connection with one( many ) of the 
        characters in the Jerusalem and she keeps it.  she keeps it going.  she is there.  at first the ship 
        had a limit beyond which it could not go a maximum resolution.  but jaycob makes it go infinite.  and 
        gl will be perfect for that.  no doubt she will play hard to get.  no doubt everybody will play hard to 
        get.  or else i am insane and none of this is real and nothing will ever happen.  some poor sad bus stop 
        to know where      the Jerusalem script cloud will have to proceed at a pace so that it gets to her before
        she gets too old.?   maybe she will age well.?  maybe all the films can be made all at once and come out 
        all at once and people can go from one to the next to the next to the next all at once.?  the cashiers 
        will have to tell everyone that there is an order.  to it.  maybe they can be made so that it doesn't 
        really matter what order you see them in.  what if J was in all the theaters at once.?   not going to 
        happen.   the first one was to be a low budget no science fiction thing.  maybe kickstarter.  and it
        would keep building from there.  but what if she gets too old?  if they can all be made at once with
        different directors then that would be good.  i know that i don't have the training to direct.  but i 
        want to direct the director.  i want a cloud of us to direct the directors.  lion's gate/   like

        waiting          what was wrong with it         i liked it          but the people who would have 
        liked it didn't come and the people who came just felt violated      not in a good       way       
        OOP        what if people just went into a standup routine every now and again        with no 
        audience       that is a real violation        maybe in the higher levels they might do that
        i want to violate the formula by looking ahead into the future and wondering what social customs 
        might be there whether or not it violates what people expect         think about the things that kids 
        do now that would have violated how people thought you could act in the past          if you went 
        back in time and put those things in a movie             would they just reject it face down and 
        complete           and burn down the theater           no matter how accurately you made it real 
        i want to burn down the theater             maybe they all speak shakespearean on the higher levels
        or some complex thing poetry that you can just barely get            in real time          yeah
        in places i want to be as funny as the daily show or politically incorrect           yeah i want 
        to hire that guy        dam i can[t think of it       he is the funniest guy on the planet
        a woody level          but he's a damm atheist         so i cant use him       ow well
        well              at least he's not a dammm athtanist               i love those
        i want to violate the formula like a taichi master violates your balance when you try to 
        grab him         and put him in a box          i need help              that miss who 30 rocks
        or some cheap down and comer with a chip on s he r(s) shoulder        haven't got a chip
        WELL GET ONE                i want one place        one place where it all comes together and it's 
        soo funny that people well         you can't buy that          and i have no idea how to get it
        can it be max horror and max funny at the same time          no not like that          cheep
        i don't like horror         horror is too easy           i don't want bullying            that's 
        too cheap          so i want to have the guy who wins the contest           as decided by truth 
        futures         to get gl's phone number and become a permanent part of her family         he can 
        call her up any time of the day or night          and if she changes her number she has to give it 
        to him just like he was a brother         if she rejects him then it will have to be like rejecting 
        a sibling           and he will be like the j esus to her y hwh  to her fans        his life is 
        public from that moment on       everything he sees everything he hears everything he does from that 
        moment on is public        and the fans can tell him what to do by truth futures           they get 
        to tell him what to do        some number of times a day according to some truth futures market
        what to say       each final word gets a number and each number can have one or more words in it 
        and each word has a truth futures market on it        and the phrases and sentences also      fans 
        are making and trading truth futures markets as fast as lightning       in real time      truth 
        futures coming up with each new word added        deciding what he will say to her in real time
        and going over everything that he does          having access to everything he does          who
        knows         maybe she will throw off her random          and marry her fn/as        through him
        yeah        he should be        so that that could happen       don't look at me man
        i'm out              it's yours now          over and out         no wait     there's more
        when the truth futures get up to a certain price on a word or phrase or sentence then that becomes
        a final word and he says it            via         a speaker in his hear  embedded into his bone
        and a microphone in his larnix               and                     that can be switched out
        highest quality           and sensors in his body monitoring      heart             rate and 
        blood pressure and stress hormones etc    and his brain waves and his thoughts we          ll
        he has to blog and life tweet everything he is thinking     and anybody who tries to cut him for 
        it w       i     ll be violated by service people coming and    no going     and they say
        pop          as they are going o      ut the door     by law nobody can cut him in any way 
        because of something they know that they wouldn't  know about a regular person    nobody can cut 
        him for things that would normally remain private   they can put it into a truth futures market 
        and the truth futures market can talk to him about it          and then we take all this and put 
        it into the Jerusalem as something that is common in the future     on certain tech levels that 
        allow it      deq                                 so he has to be good looking     slightly 
        autistic        an actor       good      or could be good        who is willing to sign
        who can somehow prove that he can take it and won't bomb out        with actors waiting in 
        the wings to take his place if he tears up the contract      but he can never really tear up 
        the contract       we want an actor who is a fan who is a born journalist exhibitionist 
        ( autistic )( gay )( a real bitch )( no )( the ken doll )( no ) who wants to be an actor from 
        the minute he wakes up on that day to the minute he dies       on stage hopefully some time 
        later       the role of a lifetime      enough                 wait         so       how does 
        he have privacy        how does he exercise his own will         he doesn't have to do what the 
        truth futures tell      he has final say     he can turn it off      if he wants      he can go
        away      he can try      and then he can come back again      but the sensors stay on       no
        he has to tear up the contract to turn them off     if he has them extracted then the contract is 
        torn up in a public execution paper shredder and the shreds lit up and burned by vodka spritzer ok 
        the contract is litterally written in stone and when it gets violated and terminated then there 
        is a public demolition by nuklear vapor Izze  ation and he is replaced by the next one in line
        after a period of arabian morning     which ends on a set date      he can go away     and the 
        contract will stay good     he can listen to the voices of the night  and decide what to do
        okay so the sensors work by beaming radio waves at some unit inside of him that then reflects 
        the data back     or somehow it uses the atp in the body to power itself           .  stop gl 
        his cira no         i want a real AO authentic arabian morning that is created by an arabian

          ( 20140727 yyyymmdd )( 8:51 Seattle )( I want one or more of the episodes to be Shakespeare set
          in the Jerusalem.  Ok    do all of them.    All of them.   up to the quality of Oliviet sorry 's
          hamlet.    Elizabethan updated into the re enactment future.    And then I want new fake Shakespeare
          plays or pieces of plays.     I want this style of language to keep coming up like the terminator
          but I want brand new stuff written by the market.  A recreation of Shakespeare's brain in all the
          brains of his fans.  And aided by one of those essence distillation programs.  go. 

          I want Arnold playing Shakespeare.  I want to take a bunch of action heroes like the expendables
          etc Stallone etc and link them all with royal s coaches and bust them out of their stereo types
          and have them do Henry the 5th.   or something.    ok           ok              ok gdi.   ok

          ( 20140727 yyyymmdd )( 5:59 Seattle )( I want John Birkey space ship painter to have a large hand
          in making the Jerusalem in the non Mandelbrot spaces.  Or maybe the Mandelbrot spaces can be informed
          by Birkey.  Modified by a Haskell function that can in sert the Birkey rainbow etc idioms into the
          Mandelbrot baroques to make the Mandelbrots more lush and with a Birkey lemon twist.  But I want 
          Birkey or some good exact essence distilled imitators if Birkey is not with us or I don't know 
          what rumours of my death were highly exaggerated.  But I want Birkey to go scitzophrenic.  I want
          all limits to just be gone.  Take it up by a factor of 10 and then take that up by another 1000x
          and then take that and.     better take that up by another trillion .  And then just keep on
          going.  from there.   I don't want any flying potatoes though.  So somebody.  I don't know who
          has to stick a bomb into the rubber buggy baby bumpers and explode it like a one of those hanging
          things that they hang down into baby cribs.  I've been robbed of the name.  calliopy.  no.  nuts.
          it's not coming.  I want everything oh it just brushed my cheek.  gone again.  come on.  no.
          flatish shapes hanging down from strings that spin around.  spinning in English eyes.  nuts.  I
          can't think of it.  like mechanical diagrams of engines where the engine is exploded and you can
          see between the parts.  I want everything to be like this.  topology baby.  topology weaving into
          the spaces between generating all sorts of architectural emotions.  miracles and wonder.  so when
          you are docking with something you don't dock with its surface.          NO        gdi!  you
          float into the thing like tanikamikazi's apartment but a jillion times more.  And you dock with the
          place you want inside of it already.  The evil can be potatoes.  They are trying to hide their
          true intentions behind a thick and heavy and ponderous outer shell.  So neuro typical.    sorry.    I didn't
          just say that.  but I just did.   And keeping all their cards tightly hidden.  And bristling.  
          Always bristling.  Offended by literally everything.  Even the absense of anything.  Essentially 
          they are looking for offence.  And if they can't find it they will make some up.  and start asking
          if they are being talked to.  Because talked to or not they are going to be taking offence.
          There is no way to stop it or avoid it.  There is nothing you can do.  So don't even try.  
          They teach me to
          do it too.  maybe they have taught me well.  maybe they will come to my rescue to cut down one of
          them barring me from getting through.  or I don't know.  I don't I won't make any estimates of
          just what the KGB might in any situation do.  I don't.  I won't do it.  or maybe they will be
          the one with the crusifix in hand and.  I won't put anything past them.  never.  and handing
          me the nails.  ok.  what the fuck was I talking about.    or what the fee.   so.  neuro.
          So the evil can be potatoes.  The rest must be open.  Transparent.  Rotating like 
          .   there is that word I'm missing again.  Rotating like mobil's.  Mobeel's?  is that it?
          mobil's ?   mobiles?  mobiiles!     mobeyel's ?     Yes and the energy conduits like blood
          vessels arteries and blue veins with round transparent balls collecting and redistributing
          and changing colors and shapes when it moves.   Like those pyramid ships in 2001 with the
          rapidly zooming calidoscopic tunnelling electric electricity repeated on all of their surfaces.
          I want to take those 7 ships to come out of the collective subconscious and make a big appearance
          right in your face.  but then their surfaces explode outwards and then slow and stop.  A cloud
          of surfaces all showing these electric tunnelling particle waves.  zooming endlessly.  into various things.
          subconscious.  keys.      that nobody sees.    You can see what the thing is thinking by watching
          these conduits.  by watching the contents inside rotating around.  So I want all the shapes and
          colors to be pure.  pure Birkey.   Birkey.    Birkey.     Birkey.     but Birkey has to have a
          Van Gogh.   Because his stuff     as it stands    is way too potatoe.  so get ready.  he is
          the least potatoe of them all but he is way at the tip of the potatoe end of the scale way out on the
          potatoe end of the scale.  as far as you can get.  in comparison.  to what I want.
          so imagine standing on a knights of staircase or platform and you can see out into space between
          the topology of the ship.  And somebody spoke and it went into a dream and moved it's topology
          out of the way to show an irregular cylinder of empty space opening out into the void in the 
          direction into which they speak.   and one of them whips out the telescope and begins to eye it
          and then goes into a real astronomical navigation that could be repeated by anyone with a
          3 inch er.  yeah.        no walls.      no caves.      no potatoes.     just a cloud of mobile
          but each of the mobile triangles is pure.   transparent    Birkey.       no walls
          between you and the space.  between you and the outer spaces.  and the stars.   no walls.
          only staircases an platforms.  no railing?    like hamlet.    no railing.    that makes all
          the characters cower.    because no railings is not an easy thing      no matter what the time
          cheats say.  it's not an easy thing.   it makes you cower.   so they should cower.   gdi.
          mc etcher stairways and platforms cutting the space up into emotions.  architectural emotions.
          with water falls and staircases leading out into the nowhere just for show.  a walk about.
          so come on and make it so.   so we have all these open topological spaces and never any never
          not one word of explanation as to what is keeping the air inside.  from whooshing out into
          the ever present vacuum all around.    it's a mystery.     and one that is never going to be
          mentioned.  at all.   ever.       if every one can violate the speed limit c and nobody even
          notices it anymore.   then I will take this one single bit of magic without explanation.
          I want a lot of things in the Jerusalem and the unlimited earth to be social techno things
          that headless people dream up that could happen and be common like internet speak or jammin
          what ever you don't call it     or just what ever    the headless market will have to dream
          it all up.   and all of it will be TOTALLY UNEXPLAINED.   I don't care.   idgad.  give me
          the money and I will not spend it on palaces.   not one.     I'll make a palace that is a
          single honey pot on the shoulder.    but I know what I want to buy.  I'll be the first homeless b
          if I can         elizabeth 

          jl mak     o ops       Berkey        damm auto correct      I thought it knew him but apparently
          not

          I think Berkey is an architect.    His ships are like doll houses with all these tiny architectural
          spaces all over the surfaces of his ships.  The ships seem to be traveling ways to deliver the
          architecture.  Even the ones that are in motion seem to be fixed in place except for one that
          is diving into a planet.  It looks like a cruise ship.  The JL MAKO is what I said but 40% what
          I was thinking.     I want it all to be done with animation cgi and built up like via the layering
          on of brush strokes.  With transparency delivered via opaque paint every where just like in the 
          paintings.  I want to
          mimic the paintings as much as possible.  But the architecture is too small.  Too tiny.  I want
          to go into those spaces.  I want the ships or spaces to be like mobiles with many dispfferent 
          parts layered on top of each other.  bright white and colored glasses.  I want stairways that
          are wild.  unexpected.  Berkey.  I want Berkey architecture.  all the way.

          ( 20140725 yyyymmdd )( 5:24 Seattle )( 

          Vix is at a bar

          3 urban cowboys walk in joined by a forth

          They see her figure and immediately assume that she is riding through life on the coat
          tails of her frontal binary constellation they make a comment hoping to see the doe eyed
          bewilderment and involuntary supplication of the center of attention always and always for 
          no good reason. They hope to add to the bullying they imagine she has received since her
          birth.  Bullying coupled with access to a guaranteed minimum of livelihood for nothing.

          And she gives them their doe eyes.  With unseen flashes of anger.  Which they don't quite
          but they do see without knowing they see they start ignoring what they see.  Which encourages them
          to come on with their bum's rush at her.  Offering free drinks free things in return for
          her continued lifelong of flush girl stupidity.  Which anyone and they could see was being
          generally enforced.

          But then all of a suddenly her spine stiffens and her posture improves and her expression
          changes.  which befuddles them.  because they suddenly see that their campaign is going to
          go nowhere.  And her voice takes on a tone of authority.  And she out wits them several 
          times in rapid succession.  While invisibly summoning a minion who comes over and starts
          talking secret politics with her.  And the another one comes over and starts talking
          category theory with her.  And then they leave and she sits there turned away but obviously
          looking right at them.  And when they know that they have her total attention.

          She looks right at them.  And they cower.

          They look around trying to assess the context and the danger.

          But she laughs and puts them at ease a little.

          I'm Vix.

          Who are you?

          And they immediately start involuntarily nodding and removing their ten gallon hats
          and move on to bowing and scraping visibly wishing they could put their hands on
          the floor and nervously looking for an exit.   any exit.

          She steps into their space and looks them over like a general inspection.

          Then pausing thinking she makes a comic turn and extends the back of her hand which makes them
          immediately curtsey and take her hand and be extremely careful not to touch her
          skin with their lips.  but she pushes her arm forwards so they touch.  And
          she does an slight impression of the three stooges and pulls her hand away quickly 
          and then slaps him with the back of her hand medium hard which knocks them all to the floor.

          And she bursts out laughing.  Really loud.

          Notes
          Audre Torgerson : Personal Banker : barbie que , well versed in sales 
          tactics, seems like, well versed in corporate speak.  she is a bright 
          fishing lure in a weary cloudy world.  eye candy to fix the wandering 
          eye and redirect it.  and put you on a USBank desired glide path, more 
          banking less wandering, more  directed, fixing me, so I'm no longer 
          wandering about, aimlessly bumping into things.  smart.  very smart.  
          and she is good at it.  nice.  a smart move by USBank.  well trained.  
          polished.  a smart move by USBank.  is she replicated in every branch?  
          that would be too good.  can I put an Audre Torgerson effect into my 
          TruthFutures.com website for people just seeing it for the first time?  
          to hook them.  to redirect them.  I should.  can I learn something from 
          this?  I should.  but what could I put in there.  pretty but not befuddlingly 
          pretty,  the hook is in her and elsewhere here.  she gently closed the book 
          on me.  a sales seduction tactic,  I felt it,  I noted it,  she executed 
          it well.  is this her own move or was she taught to do this.  she is 
          watching for signs she is having the usual effect on me that she has on 
          most guys and always thinking what to do next without seeming to.  to put 
          her charms to a purpose.  smart.  I feel like a ball that's being batted 
          around by a gentle cat.  she is careful to bring the seduction right up 
          to the edge of corporate propriety but no further.  but this seems to wear 
          on her as well.  a bit.  she wants to unleash her full affection on 
          someone, like most girls do.  with total abandon.  holding nothing back.  
          and this process of using this holy she would to her one and only to carve 
          strange men into USBank customers seems just a tiny bit stressful.  I 
          think.  for her.  for Audre.  one senses an honest frown mingled with 
          the corporate sugar.  sugar that is withdrawn at just the right moment.  
          I should learn from her.  that fixes you at the desired distance.  no 
          closer no farther.  well made.  my hat is off to her teacher(s).  if her 
          teacher is herself then all the more hatless will i go.  I will go 
          military mohawk buzz cut in honor of her then.  hopefully as her star 
          bright girl looks fade she will get smarter and smarter until she is 
          running this place.  why not.

          an ode to a pretty smart girl
          and company
          who just taught me
          much

          An arranged marriage.  How is it done.  She has no mother and 
          father?  He made those too?  He didn't bother.  He made those 
          later.  No they just tell him she comes from one of the other 
          whatchamacallits around.  Her parents both died in a fermentation 
          accident.  But why him.  Well she needs a husband and all the 
          others just happen to be taken this month so why not.  - You need
          to be settled down.  And looks to she's looks to she might be just
          the girl to do it. -  In answer to you query <a pause> <reading>
          <waiting> -- mm I didn't ask anything -- - in answer to your query 
          you're too polite to ask - and I really shouldn't answer you 
          but I will - <sly glint> - yes - you're thinking - God help you 
          - what is her great fault - that we are saddling her with you 
          - on such short notice -     you will rue that thought - her greatest
          fault - it's strange but true - is that she's too perfect.  And
          because of this no one will touch her with a tent pole and she 
          sits alone every night sewing things for people.  Who just can't 
          stand to be around her.  They don't want to it's not her fault 
          but she just drives everyone crazy.  And though they try to stay.
          Though they try to talk to her.  To be with her.  They just have
          to turn away before too long.  And flee.  Making apologies that
          drift back up to her as they quickly take their leave feigning
          bladder problems. -

          <the thought of her being shunned in this way draws up a involuntary like in him
          he knows the feeling well he feels his mouth his jaw solidifying
          he hears his sound slowing down to the point of dry pained wide eye looks
          he feels his brain turning to mud and then wild rays bursting out of the thick soup
          that he watches never knowing what calamity they will soon return
          on peoples faces

                                                 the Amish areas somewhere in the unlimited earth?  So Fredrick is
                                                 prophesying that Kiev is leaving the Amish area.  I guess.  Can't
                                                 remember now.  I think I need to stop being reluctant and keep
                                                 coming back here more often and stop waiting for the next trance.
                                                 because the next trance can't connect up with what is already
                                                 here.  it just has to go and if it goes it will have to do its own
                                                 thing and how will that link up with what is already here.  maybe it
                                                 could be linked up later.  because if I come here without any trance
                                                 then the whole thing seems kind of dead.  I can't feel it.  I don't
                                                 know what to do next.  I'm not compelled to do anything.  I feel
                                                 like a programmer.  coding something up.  distant.  how can I do
                                                 it if I feel so distant.  but if I just keep coming back here 
                                                 enough to keep everything up to date in my memory then if the
                                                 next trance comes maybe it will build off of what is already here.
                                                 yeah.       I think Lawrence Garrikon is the guy with the red

          An arranged marriage.  How is it done.  She has no mother and 
          father?  He made those too?  He didn't bother.  He made those 
          later.  No they just tell him she comes from one of the other 
          whatchamacallits around.  Her parents both died in a fermentation 
          accident.  But why him.  Well she needs a husband and all the 
          others just happen to be taken this month so why not.  - You need
          to be settled down.  And looks to she's looks to she might be just
          the girl to do it. -  In answer to you query <a pause> <reading>
          <waiting> -- mm I didn't say anything -- - in answer to your query 
          you're too polite to ask - and I really shouldn't answer you 
          but I will - <sly glint> - yes - you're thinking - God help you 
          - what is her great fault - that we are saddling her with you 
          - on such short notice - you will rue that thought - her greatest
          fault - it's strange but true - is that she's too perfect.  And
          because of this no one will touch her with a tent pole and she 
          sits alone every night sewing things for people.  Who just can't 
          stand to be around her.  They don't want to it's not her fault 
          but she just drives everyone crazy.  And though they try to stay.
          Though they try to talk to her.  To be with her.  They just have
          to turn away before too long.  And flee.  Making apologies that
          drift back up to her as they quickly take their leave feigning
          bladder problems.

          the thought of her being shunned in such a way draws up a involuntary like in him
          he knows the feeling well he feels his mouth his jaw solidifying
          he hears his sound slowing down to the point of pain
          he feels his brain turning to mud and then wild rays bursting out of the soup
          that he watches never knowing what calamity they will soon return
          on peoples faces
          bracing


  
          the elder is reading
          he sees it
          and he knows 
          where it comes from
          but he can't really feel it
          he doesn't know
          but he puts his hand up on Kiev's shoulder
          ( and whispers )<---[ a breach ]
          another sly glint
          and Kiev doesn't know if he likes all these sly glints he is getting
          his stomach starts to turn
          like finding out your father was a chicken farmer who took to raising men and then slaughtering them
          just like chickens in huge well designed and constructed structural cement pires
          the elder read this too
          .
          - and I've got a little surprise - for you - Kiev - I think you'll like it -
          -- <oh no not another> -- 
          - don't worry - it's not a trick - <thinking better of it> - <a pause> - <reconnecting> - 
          <squeezing his shoulder> 
          - you will like it - <another sly glint>
          -- <Kiev could see he was trying not to glint now but it wasn't working> --
          -- <Kiev could see that he had just realised that any further talk would just dig him in deeper> --
          -- <so he said> --
          - you're going to like it - a lot - <a distant look slightly past him> 
          - <akin to guilt but with mitigations muddying the water> -
          - a lot - <he gives Kiev's shoulder a little push> <it's time to go>
          -- Thank you sir -- - see you Sunday Kiev - -- Yes --
          -- <Kiev walks out the door wondering what just happened> --

          buy in shops today at the lowest possible price shafting it to them who ever they are
          or just trying to scrape     with the word Rebel scrawled in big red 
          letters across the cookie cutter store fronts
          and everything inside conformist made     the iron hand of the season designers    the
          central planners       the 5 year planners      the Beijing government issue blue 
          the vogue
          you better just conform      there's a jillion rules    and if you violate any of them
          in a non sanctioned way       there will be shear hell to pay
          for you little girl
          now go on out there and play     it's a beautiful sunny day    everyone looks so nice
          ( don't mind the piranha because there aren't any )
          everywhere

          all outfits are custom made      and are just whatever reflect who that person is
          and kids are trained to shrug off the haters
          by roll playing      they get up a filthy band of irate haters    and have them heckle you
          and you practice what you are going to do      you can read the lines they give you
          or try to make up your own     or say nothing      and you roll play     in steam cos    if you want to
          join      you walk up and join     if they reject you    you get rejected     if they
          don't reject you then you stand not rejected     or they teach you how to keep trying
          if you want to

          no more fake rebels       no more conformist rebellions       the kids are taught to
          not hurt anyone and do what they want      and ignore the haters
          you stand up there in front of a large band of gesticulating haters    and you feel it
          you decide what it is that you want to do    they help you    what do you want to say
          you practice it     everyday     in the assembly
          with a net
          7th period

          the teachers are no longer clueless idiots by decree 
          by decree from the larger grander spheres 
          of clueless idiots

          if you want to wear steam

          you fucking wear steam

          and then you brace yourself

          and walk right on in

          I want an episode something like American Graffiti.  where most of the stories get going right
          off the bat
          but then proceed in parallel and then keep retouching each other

          enemy is right there maybe going to do something while she is defenceless 
          but the whole thing turns out to be just a lot of talk
          the enemy was just looking bad but they weren't bad after all but were afraid not to look bad
          a very British story idea I think        what if right as the evil character is about to win with
          extreme prejudice he suddenly breaks down and he wasn't bad after all    would that cheese
          enough people off to make that episode bomb?
          his audience is just three guys in some control room
          the whole thing was faked using money from spy insider trading
          and then later on he finds out that the faking it was faked

          the the red scooter can spawn more wheels out the back but try not to make it look like
          magic I don't want this transformers bit     I want little machines to come out and rebuild her
          I want the magic to look as little like ball faced magic as possible    I don't know how
          by not showing it?  just making the sounds?       ok so she 3D prints the new parts    the tires
          are not rubber but steel like the lunar rover tires       maybe she melts down the dirt around
          her and smelts it to make ceramic       what if she has supplies circling overhead that nobody
          but Kiev and Aurora or just Kiev sees and just thinks they are birds but strange
          I don't want this transformers magic       I want there to be a reality to it a comical anti logic
          that's logical
          sounds time consuming     what if the clock is ticking     what if the
          enemy is right there maybe going to do something while she is defenceless 
          but the whole thing turns out to be just a lot of talk
          the enemy was just looking bad but they weren't bad after all but were afraid not to look bad
          a very British story idea I think        what if right as the evil character is about to win with

          the whole thing was faked using money from spy insider trading
          and then later on he finds out that the faking it was faked
          so she becomes like a scooter 
          caravan and can take on more people     like a convoy of scooter Harley's      but scooters
          but sometimes she starts sounding like a Harley and 
          all these wicked pipes and multiple angle big chrome engines sticking out I want a design
          effort on the order of 
          the discovery interior in 2001 or andromeda strain or Sid Meade or even better than Sid
          Meade  well ... a 
          scooter that looks like a Harley or a Harley that looks like a scooter how can the magic be 
          minimised like the eye blinks in 2001    and then the Harley engines turn into jet engines       
          and then the jet engines into rocket engines   and then the rocket engines into nuclear 
          engines and then the nuclear engines into some kind of alien hyper drive engines that have 
          marbles in them      so when she takes off it totally rips the landscape to shreds and causes 
          mass property damage the whole place just gets wrecked and this wreckage stays put it 
          doesn't miraculously get cleaned up somehow     like on the starting line     so she is sitting 
          there on the starting line and then she grows extra wheels out the back and the bystanders 
          get on and then she grows Harley engines to intimidate the rivals and starts making a lot of 
          noise and then the Harley engines turn into jet engines and start screaming so loud 
          everybody goes deaf and they can't hear each other for several scenes following and have 
          to use sign language for half an hour of screen time silent film the face       at first the people 
          on her are happy because they think maybe they can actually win but then they start to get 
          scared someone tries to get off but can't and the rival starts to be glad he she they are not 
          going to win this thing after all

          a 6 inch section of the road going in the direction of the drag race falls into the earth 
          leaving a ditch         the little red scooter has pipes and things going into the ground
          and equipment that looks to be left behind
          a thing with a hook on it comes up out of the ground under the front wheel of the little
          red scooter like on an air craft carrier.  so when she takes off it's like getting shot
          out of an aircraft carrier

          there are 4 blue flames that come out of her like a huge propeller like on an airplane
          spinning slowly as seen from the launch pad behind her  and these flames hit the ground like the
          helicopter blades in black hawk down     and where they hit great clouds of smoke rise up
          like from a tornado touching down

          the little red scooter is TF

          good production entity has control over the good characters and the evil production entity
          has control over the evil characters and they can fight over the middle characters.  so anything

          invoke satan go ahead.  what about the Islamists.  what about the Buddhists.  ok let's not go

          ( 20140628 yyyymmdd )( 8:12 Seattle )( I want a platform flat like a Shakespearean stage 
          with an organic shape like the shoreline of an island.  there are millions of them.  they are
          flat on top and there is a lot of machinery underneath.  there are 6 or 7 characters on top.
          and they talk.  the machinery underneath listens to them and puts up tendrils to emphasise what
          they are saying.  but these are restricted from doing a lot of supernatural magic.  they are
          more like rube Goldberg contraptions and they keep making mistakes or losing pieces that rattle
          around on the stage.  They feel like the chink in the wall.  Also the Jerusalem all around them
          is listening.  And sending out messages that the audience sees or maybe but the characters ignore
          seem to ignore.  The Jerusalem doesn't do it herself.  She has minions.  Voyueristic minions.
          That scramble around in the walls far away making up signs and furiously running around behind
          the scenes.  They are listening and disseminating and making huge efforts that just get ignored.
          The Jerusalem is watching them all.  She puts out a message sometimes.  It looks like nothing
          but it's the key to all.  So like a 3 episode sequence or something.  so these platforms float
          around and the characters speak various things that are about then but are about now.  you figure
          it out.  so these platforms occasionally touch.  And a new character can come on and another
          or more can leave.  once all but one leaves and carrie f goes on herself.  so what do they
          talk about.  Various stories and things like Georgia tall tales.  they know a lot of history.
          the history is all still there.  that kid searching so hard.  fleeting.  ok enough.  So they
          can go back to now or earlier or later to some made up future.  they can do new Shakespeare
          like from that program. etc.  musical numbers.  guitar rap.  there is also a Baraka aspect 
          to it.  Let the background and
          architecture artists go Berzerk.  Absolutely ape shit bonkers.  I want a quadzillion things
          nobody has ever seen before.  The painters the renderers.  The Jerusalem is always changing
          and she can project sculptures or video or any new thing someone can come up with.  I want
          her to be the key.  Ok Jerusalem can take on different guises.  There can be multiple
          different glorys.  some with wings.  yes.  small ones.  sometimes glory can come as multiple
          different glorys and then she can argue with herself. why not.  flattery?  I'm choosing
          flattery.  I'll make it.  kid.  oh god         I want this Mahler guy to be on the platform.

          the chance of wobbling is low.  But it's got to be an effort.  All day every day.
          it's got to be a drag.  Why celebrate the drag.
          and if anyone does wobble and gets sliced in half well that's just capital.  And push
          those without bal ance up on to razors so they can be sliced and diced over and over.
          no one is supposed to touch the veneer of lies that covers your surface.  that would
          be a violation of the code designed to get the veneer of lies to grow and grow.  until
          the milk of kindness supposedly safe inside is completely sour.  all the books all the
          movies all the stories are about this crystal growth this veneer of glass spikes around each character
          about finding the sour milk within without violating any of the rules about not
          finding out.  About not looking.  So the patterns of lies give faint clues about what
          lies within.  But not enough people were getting sliced so the definitions of the words
          were changed and the meaning of a smile was changed.  so that all those who didn't 
          know the new definitions could be knocked off their razors and die.  until the milk
          within just dried out and blew away.  but hey.  we get to kill people without risk.

          A POEM ON THE UNDERGROUND WALL
          The last train is nearly due
          The underground is closing soon
          And in the dark deserted station
          Restless in anticipation
          A man waits in the shadows

          His restless eyes leap and scratch
          At all that they can touch or catch
          And hidden deep within his pocket
          Safe within his silent socket
          He holds a colored crayon

          Now from the tunnel’s stony womb
          The carriage rides to meet the groom
          And opens wide and welcome doors
          But he hesitates, then withdraws
          Deeper in the shadows

          And the train is gone suddenly
          On wheels clicking silently
          Like a gently tapping litany
          And he holds his crayon rosary
          Tighter in his hand

          Now from his pocket quick he flashes
          The crayon on the wall he slashes
          Deep upon the advertising
          A single-worded poem comprised
          Of four letters

          And his heart is laughing, screaming, pounding <---[ ? ]
          The poem across the tracks rebounding
          Shadowed by the exit light
          His legs take their ascending flight
          To seek the breast of darkness and be suckled by the night

          around the gaga taylor swift photos ( is this taylor swift guy an actor  he 
          looks pretty much exactly like what I was envisioning for the truth futures 
          guy who would be directed by glory's fans via TF as to what he should do all 
          the time to keep her happy  does glory have fans  ok so glory is always going 
          to be dominant over this swift guy but that's ok because she's Jewish right  
          Italian Jewish what's the difference  she wants to be dominant over her man  
          so that will not freak her out like it would a civilian woman  and it links 
          to the Jerusalem too because glory should be Jewish Italian whatever so it 
          will be even better if the actual glory fans could actually tell this swift 
          guy what to do for 30 days so if life is modelling art like this it will 
          probably have a synergistic effect and once it gets going perhaps the fans 
          can keep it going to make sure this guy doesn't start screwing up or if he 
          does it can be corrected and bla bla bla bla bla bla like they could figure 
          out what he should do once a week or something what romantic thing he should 
          do for her and them because left to our own devices we tend to get lazy and 
          take her for granted and that is not a good thing so this might be a way for 
          him to escape that fate so I would like to hire him he's got the part if he 
          wants it he doesn't even have to study up for it he just has to show up 
          essentially I guess that goes for glory too because she is glory so she has 
          been studying up for it essentially all her life she's studying up for it 
          right now enough ok so I can't wait for a lot of sequels everybody is going 
          to be too old so the first episode has to be killer uz and then all the other 
          episodes have to be done all at once in parallel Goddamit enough or what if 
          the fans actually take the scenario from the TF Jerusalem script cloud and 
          actually write the part of this Swift character via TF and be a part of 
          making it enough ok so I want 75% of the Jerusalem cloud to be a noQuests 
          zone Characters only like the Swift character enough so if you want to stick 
          your movie into the Jerusalem universe then I want you but you are going 
          to have to put your script up on TF and let the market perfect it stop a 
          private market of your peers perhaps zap ok so if people wander into one 
          of the episodes and the guy comes on the screen during the ads telling which 
          episode comes prior to this one and they decide they want to start at the 
          beginning somewhat self contained episodes are needed or not then we have 
          three attendants there with 3 handheld devices don't trip on any organisms 
          and we give the customer a thumb drive that has the episode sequence on it 
          and allows them to either see a different movie now and see one of the first 
          episodes later or see one of the first episodes now in a different plex 
          in this theater plex the ticket sellers could help with this or have an 
          attendant working the line a salesman he she is to speed it up or according 
          to the drive or the money can be put onto the drive bitcoin and they can 
          take it to one of the first episodes and see them all in sequence and they 
          can stick or connect the thumb drive into their computer or tablet or phone 
          and it will tell them what to do and buy the tickets in one transaction if 
          they want a bitcoin a tiny custom thumb drive wifi mass produced cheap key

          making money for the Jerusalem cloud in it including enticing them to one

          the drive will also be a secure password keeper and people who have it 
          will no longer have to enter any more Goddam passwords and not for TF

        kid was autistic? Would that mean immediate excommunication and shunning? ) )
      ( AStoryIdea-named:copyrightBy:idea: ( escape )( copyright kjell e godø )( There is a forest barrier around 
        the waymish lands Nobody much talks about it.  If you try to cross it you seem to be walking and walking 
        over fallen trees and underbrush but then when you turn around and look back you see that you have not gone 
        more than 100 yards into the forest. It is a thick pine forest and is dark inside even in the day time. 
        There are also the leaf trees like in the cascade mountains where the leaves are way up high on the top 
        of a tall tree trunk.  If you turn around and give up and walk back out of the forest you won't recognize 
        the tree formations and land scape of the forest where you went in.  It is as if you went in one way and 
        came out another.  The synthetic humans in the waymish lands don't know they are synthetic.  Their brains 
        are connected up to a radio network like wifi.  And they have an audience inside their heads.  The audience 
        consists of people or entities who live in other places where the technology is on a higher level than the 
        waymish land.  Above the level of the synthetic humans.  The audience experiences everything the not an 
        actor thinks and feels but still retains a separation from it if desired.  Sometimes the audience can insert 
        thoughts into the mind of the not an actor.  Also when these synthetic humans get near to the forest 
        surrounding them then they get a vague sense of dread that repels them more and more the longer they are 
        in it.  As they move away from the forest this feeling subsides.  There is a road that goes through the 
        forest.  The forest is not very wide where the road crosses it.  You can stand at the edge of the forest 
        on the road and look into the dark and see light on the other side in the day time like looking down a 
        tunnel perhaps 4 or 5 foot ball fields long. If you try to walk down this road into the forest you can 
        walk 150 yards into the forest and then you don't seem to make any further progress after that.  And if 
        you look back you see that you are only 150 feet from the entrance where you entered the forest.  Also 
        thoughts about the forest barrier can be removed from the minds of the synthetic humans.  And memories 
        also.  This can be used to keep the antique humans away from the forest barrier.  They just can't keep 
        thoughts about the forest barrier in their heads for more than a few minutes.  So rad and kiev ( i need 
        different names i keep thinking Kiev instead of kiev ) try to cross the barrier on the scooter.   ) )
      ( AStoryIdea-named:copyrightBy:idea: ( the scooter )( copyright kjell e godø )( rad's bike.  It looks like 
        a girlie motor scooter but sinisterly bigger.  The back end where the motor is is bigger and sticks out 
        to the sides like a small horse's rear using dynamic torsion and automotive ovals and trim lines to give 
        the feeling of unguessed power. There are symbols like decals printed onto this back end of the scooter 
        and the scooter can change these at will like a visual language.  The scooter is bigger than a scooter 
        and the running board is a little longer so that the front of the scooter sticks out farther than a 
        regular scooter.  The wind shield is bigger and goes up high the top edge of the wind screen goes up 
        high like higher than usual.  The front and back wheels and tires are wider than a regular scooter maybe 
        not quite like a really wide chopper tire because we want it to have a demure feminine aspect but it can 
        suddenly get a lot wider like a wide chopper tire when traction is needed.  The tires can get narrower 
        when it is low on gas.  Or maybe it doesn't run on gas.  Maybe it runs on water like in back to the future.  
        The speedometer is round with radiating tick marks like on a clock.  But the tick marks get closer and 
        closer together as you get closer and closer to top speed until they are so close together that they 
        become a single blob of lines.  The lowest tick marks have numbers on their ends just like standard 
        speedometers like 10 , 20 , 30 , ... but these numbers fade out and get fainter and fainter as the 
        numbers go up.  There are two portals like exhaust ports in the back.  But these are shaped strangely. 
        They have a kind of oval aspect to them with exhaust shapers like on a fighter jet.  The oval shape lets 
        the designer put ovals in ovals near the ends of the ports to make them look more interesting.  There are 
        two smaller exhaust ports in the front of the scooter as well.  Or maybe there is a single circular exhaust 
        port around the head light in front.  Yes that's better.  That way it doesn't look like an exhaust port 
        at first.  So the scooter can change shape at will also.  So at first the rear exhaust ports look small 
        like tail pipes.  But they can get bigger if needed.  So the scooter looks girlie at first.  But it has 
        these hints that maybe that's not all that it is. So one idea is that the scooter is from a higher more 
        advanced technology place.  Like somehow a subset of rad's audience put this scooter in his hands.  And 
        he doesn't think much of it when he first gets it.  Because it just looks small and feminine and 
        unassuming.  And he just uses it for getting around town in 1950's tech land where he and lynn live.  
        I don't know if rad knows he is in an amish style artificially designated tech specified zone or land 
        or area where only 1950's technology can exist.  Maybe he is a synthetic human and doesn't know it.  
        kiev is an antique human and doesn't know about the synthetic humans all around him.  Scott might be 
        antique also.  Or maybe kiev is the only antique human.  Perhaps he was made antique with no 
        modifications according to an original DNA stored in memory from antiquity 100 years earlier before 
        the singularity.  No.  It has to be longer.  500 years or more.  Technology is static in each designated 
        tech level area so these areas can go on forever without any progress.  Or perhaps progress is made up 
        to a certain point and then everybody's memories are reset back in time and the technology is reset as 
        well.  There are places out in the three dimensional super structure inside of the earth where technology 
        is advancing at exponential pace.  And many of these synthetic humans get tired of the rapid change all 
        the time and go to one of the restricted tech areas to live a simpler life.  Embedded in all the 
        technology is the law that higher tech shall not affect lower tech or attempt to drive lower tech out 
        of existence or delete the restricted tech areas.  Just like there is the endangered species act there 
        is the endangered tech act.  And the equal opportunity for humans act.  Which all new tech must follow.  
        rad has a car as well as the scooter.  Just like the real rad.  And it gets all dusty and wrecked but it 
        can repair itself and clean itself and wash and wax itself and turn shiny and spangly again.  The scooter 
        is puke pink sometimes when it wants to be really feminine and other times when it wants to get really 
        cool it can go red with a thick layer of lacquer so that the blue of the sky mixes with the red and 
        makes it look really cool.  And somewhat dangerous. So rad and kiev try to drive out of waymish land 
        down the road but they can never get more than 150 or 250 yards into the forest even though they seem 
        to be going pretty fast.  The scooter is looking pretty pink. They have got it floored but 55 is just 
        not enough.  The scooter has a motorcycle throttle on the handle bar and also a pedal on the floor.  
        You can get it going with either one.  So some more strife ensues I don't know what.  Maybe kiev and 
        rad get chased somehow or i don't know what.  But rad remembers or figures out or they both figure 
        out that if they go fast enough the scooter starts to rise up off the ground.  The scooter doesn't 
        have wings so it just goes straight.  This is because everything is being held down by centrifugal 
        force and not gravity.  So if you go the same speed that the synthetic planetary bubble is going 
        around the true center of the earth then you are standing still and become weightless. And so they 
        get the idea that they can jump over the forest instead of driving through it on the road. Originally 
        rad drove the other direction down the road into the waymish area and that was fine but then when he 
        tried to get back out again then he couldn't.  So the scooter at some point turns into its cool fast 
        self as they are going to try to put this plan into action.  It got fast earlier which was how they 
        figured out they could make it float.  They don't know that the earth they know is just a fake earth 
        in a bubble with a fake plasma sky that is rotating around the center of the hollowed out earth. There 
        are multiple of these planetary bubbles inside of the earth.  The earth is very big and hollowed out 
        by the builder machines that ran amuck some time after the singularity and turned the earth inside out 
        in order to get more living space for a growing population of synthetic humans.  And a few antiques. 
        So they see that the scooter has changed at some point and this sets them to wondering.  When kiev 
        first sees the scooter in it's pink mode he is so shocked by it since he has only ever known wrought 
        iron that he has pounded into shape himself and he has a future shock that reduces him to mush.  He 
        keeps touching the smooth manufactured perfect lines.  With his mouth hanging open in abject awe.  And 
        the scooter starts changing into a racier sexier format as he keeps touching her and this causes even 
        more future shock.  And then rad gets it too but he turns away.  rad keeps turning away until he becomes 
        a double inhabiting two states at once.  not future shocked and future shocked both.  So five of them 
        decide to try to jump the forest.  rad is in the drivers seat.  and lynn is on his lap.  And scott is 
        sitting on the long seat behind rad.  maybe lynn looks like grethe.  and there are new running boards 
        going down the sides of the scooter and kiev is on the left side and aurora is on the right side of 
        the scooter standing on the running board and holding onto each other and onto rad and scott and lynn.  
        need new names.  So they go way down the road and turn around and sit there planning.  And as they are 
        planning and out of their sight the scooter keeps changing under their feet.  But it should be classy 
        magic that is subdued and more realistic like in 2001 a s o and not super bombastic like in a lot of 
        movies.  Probably only kiev can see the scooter changing and the others don't ever look at it long 
        enough to see.  Or it keeps changing back when ever they look at it.  We see it changing and kiev sees 
        it changing but the others don't.  Or they tend not to.  So they take off and the speedometer keeps 
        going up and as it goes up the numbers on the tick marks get more and more solid and distinct.  And 
        the numbers keep going up and up and up. Until they are going 600 maybe.  And it has to be a real 600 
        and not 35mph because that's as fast as the camera truck can go.  And then they lift off and float 
        up into the air as the ground is rotating below them. So it looks like they are going to whiz right 
        over the forest barrier but as they get half way over it and seem to be passing over the mid point 
        then they can see their goal is at hand.  Easy peasy.  But then the forest starts to grow out in 
        front of them.  And now they are starting to lose altitude due to air friction and they start to sink.  
        There should be some more dire evil about the forest so that you really don't sink back down into it.  
        And so this keeps going and it looks like they are not going to make it but then there is house or a 
        building up ahead and when the forest gets to the house it stops growing and bounces back a little 
        like in Tron.  So now they might make it.  And they are trying to will the scooter forward to make 
        road on the other side of the forest.  But they come short and fall down through the branches of 
        the leaf trees and hit the road like 25 yards from the light and rad guns the scooter and the 
        speedometer rises 400 500 600 700 and the road beneath them is whizzing  by at 700 miles per hour 
        but they are losing ground.  The trees on either side are still but the road is whizzing by at 
        700 miles per hour and they are slowly but surely losing ground and getting further and further 
        from the light.  So they start yelling something or other i don't know what and kiev is yelling 
        at rad to floor it and he says that he is.  And it looks like they are not going to make it but 
        then kiev sees the pedal on the floor boards and stamps it to the floor and the exhaust ports in 
        the back fire up.  And they slowly start to make progress 800 900 and they get out into the light 
        and are almost to the end of the place where they can see how the new road is being created out in 
        front of them like 20 feet ahead.  And then these two big fans like wind mills rise up out of the 
        ground where they were  just created and instantly start spinning so fast that they can't be seen.  
        And now the skin on their faces is flapping around at super sonic speeds and now the port in the 
        front of the scooter lights up and produces an air wind shield and then the force on them reduces 
        and they stop getting ripped apart.  And now something happens i don't know what.  They are held 
        in place at the end of the road.  With the two fans blaring.  And kiev starts talking to her or 
        something and the orange flames in the rear ports turns blue and gets a lot hotter and gets a weird 
        hallow ring around each port and then they blast through the fans and take off up into the air again.  
        And kiev takes his foot off the pedal and rad looses the throttle and the scooter turns several 
        shades pinker as they slowly start to descend.  Back down to the road beneath them but then the 
        road swerves away to the left and then start coming down into a corn field or some damn thing.  
        And as they get closer to the tops of the corn then the wheels of the scooter extend downwards like 
        more of an off road format.  And then they hit pay dirt and corn hits them all upside and the 
        scooter pitches sideways and they all go flying in every different direction landing in the corn.  
        So then they have to find each other again and some dialog ensues.  Maybe they can't find the 
        scooter anywhere.  The scooter has blushed away or something.  It tries go go back to being a 
        rickety old dusty scooter.  But the jig is up and more dialog ensues.  As they try to talk to 
        it.  But it won't listen.  It just keeps getting ricketier and ricketier.  Or something. It 
        blushes pinker and pinker and then takes on a layer of grey dust.  And its spokes start breaking 
        like old guitar strings. And then they come upon a freeway and kiev and aurora and scott have 
        more future shock because they come from 1820.  kiev and aurora ( name? ) and scott seem to be 
        screaming all the time or something because they are having acute future shock.  So you need 
        really insightful actors to do the future shock right. They need to put into their faces and 
        voices what we all are or will soon feel deep down.  It has to be subtle. and without a lot of 
        sawing of the air.  But it has to be real.  Future shock and culture shock is at the core. Usually 
        people in movies just take everything in stride.  A couple lines of dialog and completely up 
        to speed and thoroughly and completely modern.  I don't thing that is real.  I don't think that 
        real people can look on the face of YHWH like it was a burnt out fluorescent light bulb unaffected.  
        I don't think that is real. So one of the movie episodes is a road trip.  And you can do all sorts 
        of things with the scooter.  And the synthetic earth is a half sphere inside of another half 
        sphere.  So as they are pealing out to get away from the cops or whatever that are chasing 
        them they actually start to feel gravity going side ways as they get closer and closer to the 
        edge.  And finally gravity is going parallel to the ground and pulling everything and the cop 
        cars forwards until finally the ground pulls away below and everybody falls off the edge of 
        the world.  Into the carbon super structure inside the earth that keep the different synthetic 
        earths in place.  The center of the real earth is a spherical empty space.  And everything is 
        being pulled outward by centrifugal force.  Maybe the scooter lights up a different super 
        modern physique and flys them all to one of the advanced technology areas.  Where they meet 
        finally some of their awdience.  No they don't meet them yet.  They have to be plagued by them 
        first. Vampires on the Jerusalem? Devils on the Jerusalem?  Like viruses being continually 
        removed.  By the autonomous mind probes that are continually removing all evil thoughts and 
        sending them out into the asteroids that trail behind the Jerusalem in a network of cables.  
        There can be Star Wars Star Trek Gravity type space episodes using only conventional space 
        out amongst these trailing asteroids that are like a wooden hydro plane being dragged behind 
        a boy on his bike in the 1960's.  Or like a foot fungus.  Or like a no death penalty.  Because 
        no evil thoughts are allowed on the Jerusalem.  Probably this is not the first New Jerusalem.  
        But the latest one to be sent out.  Maybe it is the Jerusalem 17.  Or maybe the previous ones 
        were not called Jerusalem but this one with the autonomous mind probes is called Jerusalem 
        and was built without human hands.  None of them were.  Perhaps there could be comedy instead 
        of drama with the mind probes if the AI entity running the mind probes was more weary mother 
        mary rehab rather than hard ass father aneal.  Or maybe both. Or all three.  In revelations 
        there is something that sounds like a laser beam coming out of the sky? Maybe the scooter 
        turns into a metal woman at some point a really curvey one with a world class bust line 
        that he finds hard to resist and tries to have sex with or become kiev's wife or mistress. 
        Maybe she can produce synthetic humans or new little scooters with synthetic brains based 
        on a  combination of kiev's genes and her genes.  Yes the scooter is named Aurora and she has 
        graphic metal sex with kiev and produces little blue and pink scooters and she is able to 
        sit with kiev and choose between the different possible traits.  But some traits they leave 
        up to random chance because it's just too 21st century to decide on all the traits of your 
        offspring and be really hard ass about it all with a super controlling super conforming 
        super optimizing super competitive 2 by 4 stick up your butt sphynx.  Aurora has sex with 
        kiev and while they are doing it she modifies his equipment to make it more for him.  And 
        for her.  So aurora ( name? ) gets really pissed and jealous at kiev when she finds out. 
        But kiev is like he just masterbated or autosexed or something like that because Aurora 
        is just a machine. And then they both find out that aurora is a shodilly produced slapped 
        together synthetic human whose sole purpose is to keep kiev from upsetting the other waymish 
        participants with his atheist anarchist spoutings because maybe Aurora gets jealous too?  
        Maybe there is a metal synth cat fight?  Comic relief?  Or maybe Aurora is not very upsettable 
        and she just made an off hand remark as aurora's upsettion tries to get a rise out of them 
        and Aurora says it to diffuse the situation?  Can we do something like the movie Her?  
        Where the dialog is oscar worthy even though there are high concepts about?  Perhaps the 
        high concepts could be introduced in a previous high concept movie episode and this lower 
        budget episode is just about the relations between Aurora and aurora and kiev and etc and 
        Aurora and kiev's kids.  And then aurora finds out that her own kid making ability was 
        turned off by her maker.  And to get it turned back on again she has to become a different 
        person.  Which she won't do.  At first.  But then when Aurora has her babies then aurora 
        gets so wound up she asks to be transformed into an antique like kiev and so she can 
        have a babie.  Her brain becomes antique and so she thinks differently somehow than 
        she used to.  Her programming is gone.  What's aurora's name?  it keeps coming back 
        aurora. And aurora keeps wanting kiev to stop having sex with Aurora.  But kiev cant 
        see why not since she has given him enough juice to do them both and she's just a 
        scooter after all.  Which makes Aurora sort of mad but not really because Aurora 
        doesn't have many really strong emotions and is very self assured.  And why wouldn't 
        she be.  Because she's perfect.  Where as aurora is not perfect because antiques 
        can't be perfect.  The moment they are made perfect is the moment they cease to be 
        antiques. These ideas should be separated somewhat into separate ideas. So aurora 
        gets a car.  And now the shoe is on the other foot.  A car named gari.  And now it 
        is kiev's turn to be jealous.  But even though it drives him crazy she is not 
        interested in gari sexually and is just being nice.  It looks like a motor scooter 
        and has a  feminine quality.  It has some stickers on the round back like the my 
        little ponies stickers on the back of the the ponies. The stickers keep changing.  
        The audience can see them change when the characters are not looking at them.  The 
        characters don't realize that the stickers are changing.  Perhaps the stickers can 
        have their own language which predict what will happen or comment on what happened 
        recently. kiev or whatever his final name is notices the changes and tries to point 
        out the changes but when ever he does or whenever the other characters are looking at 
        the stickers they change back to what the stickers were when the characters first 
        looked at the scooter and when they turn back away then they turn back into what kiev 
        was trying to point out.  kiev keeps trying and trying to point out the changes but 
        the others can never see it and they start getting mad at him and commenting on his 
        sanity.  And as they get a little madder mild they begin to self congratulate that 
        they are not crazy and in so doing begin more and more to ignore the scooter.  And 
        finally kiev gives up speaking about it but just keeps watching while the others 
        are talking oblivious about some thing much more practical and reasonable and on 
        point and on message but the decals show that everything their perfect logic is 
        concluding is completely bass ackwards wrong and will probably get them killed if 
        put into action.  If the decals can be believed.  He tries to tell them but his 
        ability to explain is really piss poor and his crippled logic is no match for their 
        perfect rhetoric and glib fast talking.  So the audience realizes that they are 
        fucked and the option that will save them will not be taken.  And it's very ironic. 
        kiev tries to point at the decals at first but that's just crazy talk.  Then he gives 
        up that tack but can't make that work either.  So he starts just looking at the 
        decals trying to decipher them while everybody else is doing something that is Not 
        absolute awful Lunacy that actually moves them forward toward total and complete 
        destruction.  Sometimes he is looking at the decals and the change back to the 
        initial decals and stay there right when it was getting good and he realizes that 
        the others are looking and that's why the decals are blocked.  Then they stop looking 
        that way and the decals get to something really good.  Then just as the final message 
        is coming they force him to turn away from it and stop being a low down slob of a bum 
        an help and stop being so lazy that they get killed then it will be all his fault.  
        So he starts checking what it is saying and winds up winning some points that are 
        eluding the others.  Maybe.  Just ideas.  Here. Maybe at one point the decals seem 
        to turn sadd and he gets horrified and can't see what their game is? And then they 
        seem to try to explain and make it up and get forgiveness for why he pushed he off 
        the ledge. But he just can't believe anything they say by then.  Good or bad it's 
        all just noise and he stops looking. But the decals keep upping the amperage to 
        get him to look.  Finally he gets a camera and starts taking video of the decals 
        and making reports on everything the decals are saying but by then it's so involved 
        that he can't explain most of it so he dumbs it way down and avoids the stuff he can't 
        explain.  At great physical mental cost.  because it's totally unnatural.      he 
        finally starts to get some traction but decides he is never going to get through to 
        these blind people and he needs to find others who will have an easier time listening.  
        The decals try to keep him from talking.  They make double meanings half positive 
        and the other half veiled threats which make him wonder w Why.  Half awe inspiring 
        and the other half rotting pestilence and putrefaction.  w Why.  half chaos half 
        creation      Lets see.   something.   Olympics Opening.  he won't stop    he won't 
        listen.   They grouse something fierce but it doesn't affect them good for you

          ( kiev is looking through his telescope at some constellations and one of the stars goes 
          out for 37 minutes and then comes back on again.  Perhaps he begins to see that the stars

          kjell e godø )( 20140215 yyyymmdd ) ( 5:20 seattle )( Ok so the way to prevent the 
          expected market manipulation in extreme illiquid markets is to not let anyone but 
          the market administrator? see the truth future's price.  Studies have shown that 
          this works.  Various statistics about the truth future's price will be published 
          at certain intervals like perhaps every 17 days. So the 20 day and 50 day and 200 
          day moving averages and the standard deviation and mean and Sharpe ratio and historical 
          and implied volatility etc could be published once every agreed upon period of time 
          like once a week or once every 17 days.  Or once every 13 days.  This would be done 
          to keep people interested and keep on truth voting. Once a month or once a quarter 
          or once every 57 days the actual price of the truth future and all the transactions 
          of all of the truth voters would be published into the public record along with the 
          identity of each truth voter. Bitcoin will be used for the truth futures money.  
          Truth voters will have to give up their bitcoin anonymity which i think can be done 
          with Bitcoin. Perhaps each truth voter will have to get a coinbase.com account and 
          send in notarized documentation like MtGox requires and a hand written notarized 
          essay about why they should be allowed to truth vote and whatever else they want 
          to say and images of these essays will be posted.  Also drawings can be included 
          in the essay(s).  A voter can publish as many of these notarized essays as they 
          want. Each truth voter starts out with $1000 or less in their truth voting account 
          which is stored on coinbase.com. Each transaction will be stored and tracked and 
          checked to make sure that the $1000 limit is never breached.  If it is breached 
          then a public notice will be published and the transaction requested to be undone.  
          If there is an appeal or if the transaction is not undone then the total public 
          record or the truth voter's transactions will be published and a truth futures 
          market started on it about whether or not the transaction should be reversed.  
          If the truth vote is good enough to reverse it and the voter still won't reverse 
          it then the voter's account is cancelled for some period of time or until the voter 
          can make public hand written notarized repentance.  Each truth voter gets 70 times 
          7 of these chances to repent or however many Jesus said there should be. Each 
          truth voter's truth futures voting account can have more than $1000 in it but 
          the only way to get it to have more than $1000 in it is by gaining truth voting 
          profits for truth voting well and truly done. Truth futures transactions will 
          no longer be called transactions or trades but they will be called votes or 
          specifically truth votes. Also if the value of a bitcoin increases then a truth 
          voter's account could have more than $1000 in it?  This might favor initial 
          truth voters too much and this rule might need to be changed if the initial 
          truth voters get too much power by this route or there could be a formula 
          that ... ? Perhaps any bitcoin value generated truth voting profits would be 
          taxed away each month or restored if the value of bitcoin dropped.  Perhaps 
          these taxes could be invested in junk bonds or SPY or treasuries or bitcoin  
          or something. Initially truth futures will be used to vote on movie scripts 
          here etc. But eventually they might be used to manage entire productions. 
          Eventually they might be used for general corporate or open corporate CEO 
          free management. Every digital entity in the system can have a truth futures 
          market(s) attached to it.  And each truth futures market can have 1 or more 
          for profit or free online textual graphical communications forums attached to 
          it. So there have to be legal licenses and what not created for all of this. 
          So the story of the truth voters will be part of the Jerusalem movie cloud in 
          the 2013 level technology planetoid inside the earth.  It will be a low budget 
          or youtube or netflix video series probably. Some of these videos can be ads 
          for the truth futures open corp management free management system(s).  These 
          management system will allow all people to become open corp voters and will 
          allow them all to truth vote on a second by second basis about how the open 
          corp should be run and allowing the truth futures to make every corporate and 
          even operating decision in an open corp.  OpCop? There can be automated truth 
          futures voting bots coded in BorgLisp.  BorgLisp will be the official system 
          language/OpSys.  There will be no unsecure languages like C orJava etc allowed.  
          And special BorgLisp secure open hardware like the iPad with all encrypted executables 
          etc should be made also. There can be all sorts of derivatives on the truth 
          futures like vanilla options or exotic options etc. If the truth futures voting 
          model of open corp management free management becomes popular then arbitrary 
          limit truth voting markets that compete directly with all the trading markets 
          that exist today might be created. Perhaps there might even be a country 
          somewhere that takes up the truth futures management free management model 
          as a secure open form of sovereign government.  Maybe in africa or somewhere. 
          And if this worked then perhaps even bigger countries could vote in the 
          standard truth futures sovereign corruption free governance free sovereign 
          governance open truth constitution.  And limited account size truth futures 
          on that truth constitution could begin to truth vote ( $100 account limit ).  
          To adapt it to local customs traditions religions and tastes. And then all the 
          politicians can go home.  Every truth voter will be a politician and corporate 
          manager and master of the coming robot AI invasion. Human level or above AI 
          entities won't be allowed to vote.  I suppose as they become better and better 
          at emotion mimicry or even as they get true biological emotions perhaps this 
          last human protection will eventually fall get voted out and then the human 
          era will end.  And antique human will be born and come under the jurisdiction 
          of the truth endangered species act. If a truth futures voting market becomes 
          liquid enough to pass certain liquidity standards then the instantaneous 
          price of those truth voting markets can be published at certain intervals 
          which get shorter and shorter as liquidity increases. We try to minimized 
          corruption and manipulation and maximize access to as many truth voters as 
          possible. The entire universe can be run by truth voting. Quite e d ) )

          knew it was a dream.  i could feel it.  it felt real but i knew that i was 
          directing the actions of the other characters and then that realize slipped 
          away.  it was too bright there was a sparkly sprinkling of white pixie dust 
          in the air.  i see you.  in the woods behind our old house in the leaf part 
          between the two pine sections to the north and the south of the big cedar 
          in the middle 1960 nw houses fenced to the west and condos access drive to 
          the east.  the trail went straight from the north pines south through the 3 
          foot high cold wet sagged under fern sticks with grey branches high above 
          holding up the overcast.  it looped slightly to the east as it hugged around 
          the base of the tall cedar and then continued south into the pines down that 
          there.  there was a man with a hatchet up in the top of the cedar too far up 
          to see so we would boys fly as fast as we could under the cedar to avoid the 
          chop to get to the road that bounded the forest to the south beyond the thick 
          tall pines and fenced across the road more day sleepers sleep.  it was a small 
          forest but a good one.  i used to go out there at night and hug the big wet 
          black pines in the south and listen to the cars going.  my cheeks pressed 
          hard into the black bark arms stretched wide.  and pray them not torn by some 
          wife'(s) big stiff rear end rubber baby buggy bumpers.  the size of a small 
          football field.  once i climbed a south pine above the entering trail and i 
          could see the kids coming about a mile down below like toys they could not 
          see me i was up too high.  so when they got below me proceeding out of view 
          south i started yelling strange calls in a loud qhoir boy holler.  i was a 
          choir boy in 6th grade and in the seattle opera house all city choir boys 
          angel jam.  they couldn't tell where the calls were coming from and began 
          exclaiming.  and as it kept up apace they lit out at top speed for the road.  
          young boys fear flying.  so the man with the hatchet was real after all.  so 
          finally i got tired of darting under the cedar every day dodging raining 
          hatchets like the wind.  well previous.  and decided i would go the hell 
          up there and have a chat.  i figured i would probably do all the talking.  
          so i surveyed the bottom branches and used two like ropes to walk up the tree.  
          so i kept climbing higher and higher and then i would go out there during storms 
          and ride the wind and the rain in the dark and i kept going up up up the ground 
          dropping away below leaves dropping away below and the whole situation opening 
          wide descending all around in every direction.  until it was just me and a 5 
          inch pole with cedar green blushing my breathless hales a sturdy branch to 
          sit on a chair and me and the cedar and the setting blues.   purples deep grad.  
          a flare.  and sett.  wow.  she's beautiful.  her bald clouds tricking.  a rare 
          sight.  that flying fear is such a waste.  let it dwindle into a scout.  we will 
          lean in and laugh ourselves to death if and echo the he leaned against.  
          resistless.  10.  so there you are.  like.  dam mac keyboard.  30 feet north of 
          the cedar.  framed in black.  key lit.  50 feet north of that.  looking south.  
          i am 3 or 5 children not yours seeming but charitably pixied dance.  - play round 
          below you about your hips half on the trail half off.  raising play finger tips 
          up to yours.  half but not dazzled in the invisible pixie dust.  the pixie 
          dust that floats all around you generate by being 5.6 inch tall.  with a voice 
          like.  ten thousand voices.  created by a hundred thousand engines.  snow.  
          well.  yeah.  i want to look into your my eyes and see if i could see any 
          pixie dust reflect.  i fell like this had to be done Now.  so i leaned back 
          into the deep plush of the endless hassle.  and dreamed myself you.  look east.  
          as your eyes broke from the dancing child before you. coming up and locked.  
          you knew me.  i kept this dream slowly south. orbiting round you west of you 
          looking east into your snow white halo of dust. locked.  in the exact moment i 
          could not hesitating i said  Hi.  a slight surprise.  Hi.  still proceeding.  
          i raised my fingers touching relaxed and you took me in yours.  briefly.  hi.  
          and so still proceeding we let go as i turn from you east rotate south again 
          and back out of existence.  i woke.  oh bLoody hell.  is this what i really think?  
          trying to wipe the snow off the bed.  and listed the ways that it could all 
          be just a load of white.  white or no.  what do i care.  it's nothing to do 
          with me.  i just want to see.  to scout out.  and then i'm out.  and then forget 
          the whole thing.  as best i can.  staring right at it YellinG and thinking of 
          Someone else.  and resistless. back out of existence. ) )

          ( copyright kjell e godø )( 20140301 yyyymmdd ) 15:48 ( I give up on the idea of 
          making the first Jerusalem movies rated r or even x because of wild married sex 
          between kiev and aurora.  So i want to make a special credit card gated website 
          where all those monogamous sex scenes are most gratuitously included. and included 
          and included and included.  The film goes to 6 hours or more long.  With a button 
          that skips to the next good part.  i want to completely break apart this idea that 
          people have that married sex doesn't exist.  it doesn't.  but i want to break down 
          that notion and replace it with something else.  aurora is special compiled to be 
          irresistible to kiev via a telescopic virus transmitted brain scan that mapped out 
          all the sexual attraction sites and 3D contour receptors in his brain ( maybe guys 
          are better at 3D space perception partly for this very reason. certain shapes and 
          silhouettes are DNA burned into our brains and it doesn't seem to matter if the 
          image is actually connected to something real.  The image and the ability to 
          project it into a dream is all that matters.  whereas women's minds seem to 
          recognize stories instead.  plots.  romances.  And there is more emphasis therein 
          on the stories actually being connected to a physical reality.  not.  girls are 
          suckers for words on a page.  whereas guys are suckers for an eye balled image 
          that keys into the 3D projection machines in our brains ).  So when kiev sees 
          aurora he has to touch her and the barrier to entry is low to her and when he 
          touches her then he goes berserk which causes her to go berserk a little later 
          on.  i can imagine it.  so i want to create it.  whether or not i should.  So 
          there could be one version that just gets down to it as quickly as possible and 
          hits all the pay dirt spots and keeps on hitting it and then there can be another 
          version of Jerusalem that is slower and more lit and artistic about it and you 
          can set sliders on the playback as to how much of each you want ( down to it or 
          artistic.  youtube razor thin blades. or playboy lit and with a lot of mindless 
          social defense lizard brain stem spark resistance and incessant weeping up to the

          and he says: What in the blue fuck was that?  ( What the Hell was that? ) And she

          gets younger and younger day by day.  Does she get the same hormones as the other

          into a rising black hole spiraling and cutting a hole through the earth and up into

          grows engines which it lights up down the shaft going down and taxis up into free

          anywhere.  it just punches through empty space.  maybe it vaporizes the place where 
          kiev comes from.  ?  maybe not.  Maybe a few cells were recovered just prior to ignition.  
          by nano bots.  so they get on a small ship and go winging into the Jerusalem into 
          all the spiral arms forming the cube.  And they fall into one of the ink blots into 
          the fringe around one of the ink blots.  Cross shaped ink blots ?  heart shape ink 
          blots? the ink blot has to repeat like the mandelbrot ink blot.  the ink blots have

          of these ink blots kross shaped heart shaped what the blot expands and they shrink 
          and the spirals spiral outward and inward.  An infinite complex.  Maybe they get lost 
          in there.  And start trying to get back out again.  Maybe the Jerusalem creates 
          synthetic humans out of the rocks and the stones which burst into song.  DNA accurate 
          descendants of David.  the godlike being rises up to the bridge.  bridge?  no everywhere 
          is the bridge.  okay so peoples brains get scanned and the Jerusalem won't let anyone 
          still harboring the love of money.  But those people still hanging on can hang on to a 
          christmas tree like structure of spidery web like stiff and bendy spirals like a spiders 
          web out into space trailing behind the Jerusalem that catches rocks and meteors and 
          asteroids like planets where the Star Wars bars and brothels and space ports and drinking 
          dens get constructed by the people still hanging on to it trailing behind the Jerusalem 
          maybe one of the people hanging on to it hollers : What about me?  And then the Jerusalem 
          spins the web out behind it.  And ships can fly from asteroid to asteroid and from space 
          port to space port using nothing but conventional ion drives.  maybe the Jerusalem 
          flies into mars or europa or one of the moons and slices it and the pieces come out the 
          other side and get caught in the web.  And then the Jerusalem takes off for the next 
          star using a huge solar sail and millions of fusion drives and when it gets there 
          it finds a planet and opens up an complex empty cylinder which goes through the 
          Jerusalem and a new black hole collapses and sparks two fountains into the cylinder 
          and collapses down into a gold and silver ice seed.  no.  the seed should be a 
          silver mirror ball like a black hole that reflects the gold behind it momentarily 
          to spark a gold mirror like a black hole so the seed is a black hole a tiny one 
          with some kind of energy field around it keeping it from sucking everything around 
          it.  Or not.  Maybe it just doesn't suck for some reason.  And then the godlike being 
          lets the seed drop onto the planet and a million different new Jerusalems spawn and 
          ignite their engines and make for all the stars in the sky.  Filled with all kinds 
          of synthetic animals and people and beings.  And the lion will eat dust.  and lay 
          down with the lamb.  synthetic creatures maybe some of them look like machines like 
          in biomega.  maybe the Jerusalems make their way to sagitarious and the massive black 
          hole and use the jets to make for another galaxy?  Maybe not.  okay where is the 
          science grounding?  seems we are getting way into fantasy here.  What the hell.  
          frozen.  maybe a star could be coaxed into spinning in a certain direction.  a new 
          star could be constructed out of gas and pointed in the right direction and then when 
          it collapses into a hypernova the fountain could be used to propel a new Jerusalem 
          out into intergalactic space no a hypernova is too brief.  more fantasy.  well they 
          could avoid the initial fountain and then feed matter into the black hole and use 
          the fountain to sail to the next galaxy.  so the Jerusalem is an infinite complex 
          spiral arm fractal with ink blots like krosses or kearts or both or neither maybe 
          the ink blot changes shape and transparency as you move around it.  like on of 
          those plastic 3D effects.  eah.  and the Jerusalem is created by a silver and 
          gold mirror ball like a black hole.  don't call it a black hole.  let people 
          figure it out by the reflections that move across it.  ok  they make hundreds 
          of millions of new stars and collapse them all into black holes and then sail 
          the fountains to the next galaxy Andromeda.  And then onward out into the galactic

          twisted out into 3 dimensions into a systematic tangle that comes outward.  i 
          don't want the actual mandelbrot filaments but something similar.  the ink blot 
          is flat and 2D and rotates so that as you orbit around it it always faces towards 
          you even as the filaments coming out are orbiting in the usual 3D way.  And if 
          you go into the ink blot then what?  you sweep away the stars from the blue 
          thresh hold?  ( bloody heck these frozen let it go gma choralers are nuts 
          everybody wants to be a diva i guess ice ice ice making ice hiding the ice man 
          these people can't sing and that's the point its like singing in tube church 
          way in the black -yay!!! black eyed everybody sing especially the ones 
          who -can't!!! what storm hiding the ice and then abandoning security and 
          letting them know and letting the storm go and making a lot of new ice hmm 
          abandoning hiding the ice and then making a lot of new ice an ice chateau 
          fortress ok it's more like a shack a fonda shak and then she just stops?  
          She goes into stasis?  cold storage?  we'll get back to you?  just hold on?  
          what's my motivation!?  ok so i'm just going to sit here and wait.  right.  
          blllody hell not this again.  wait.  ok i'll wait.  i'll show you waiting.  
          i'll do the best waiting you ever saw.  my waiting whall bring down the 
          house on the blue threshold.  just you wait.  i don't know but it could be.  
          my prediction.  haven't seen frozen yet.  no spoilers.  hi kjell she cries

          sawing. an antiChramlet 4:07 min of unceasing air sawing you go girl but i 
          can't watch    give me a minute    a storm of people objecting to the ice

          storm.  the queen of isolation.  i don't know.  i'm looking more for a light 
          seattle drizzle myself.  that's what we do in seattle.  we don't storm much.  
          although we do blow once in a while.  and that's the royal pain in the but 
          probably imported by foreigners and detroit jersy girls which is why i'm 
          avoiding it   knock wood.  take out the trash you idiot.  ok tomorrow.  
          100% promise.  not much snow.  maybe once year.  maybe some snow machines 
          will fix that.  like in so chi or New Yo k( ? ).  then it's like bloody 
          Atlanta here.  biblical proportions.  dogs and cats living together. -! mass 
          hysteria.  dazed and confused shirtless sleeve freeway pedestrians.  pocket 
          protectors not protecting.  we drizzle.  when we dress we look out at the 
          100% chance of drizzle every ding dong day and then keep right on dressing 
          without any regard or affect to whatever the drizzle may be or whatever the 
          dirty weather or worse company may be or if it doesn't drizzle then we just say 
          that if it's not drizzling now then it's a 100% chance of sure that it soon 
          will be   again and then we turn our brains off into a complete shutdown 
          which is not what they say in Bergen in Bergen they say that if it's not raining 
          then it soon will be.  in Beergen hey don't mess around with drizzle.  they 
          go right to the hard stuff.  drenched in Bergen.  you should be so lucky.  
          in seattle we don't rain we mostly just drizzle.  drizzle it right on in there.  
          onto the tops of our bald down undeer thin skin pates because we don't wear 
          rain gear and we don't wear hats an we don't use umbrellas.  we just let it 
          drizzle it right on in there and then drip down punching through a thin 
          resistance of hair above to splatter our wet backed up scalps under the 
          leaking hair net of cold hair spray and glue and into our salt eyes and 
          onto our lips which we may part briefly just a bit and let a drop or two 
          in diverted from on their way on down the storm drains and in to total 
          pollute the sound and kill all the salmons and killer whales which we would 
          really rather not but what are you going to do etc virkensoc huh ) fking 
          enough    okay so the godlike being is standing on a long thin arm of 
          structure way out into the middle of a big cylindrical void on the surface 
          of the earth which is open and hollow inside because of the builder robots 
          that ran amok ages ago.  There is at least a circular opening above with 
          stars in it.  The center of the earth is not hollow.  The iron core is 
          still down there.  Although a little smaller perhaps than before the 
          builders got to it.  And the godlike being has on a white robe like a 
          wedding dress with a huge long train like 3 miles long.  except it's a 
          male godlike being or maybe you can't really tell for sure.  And maybe 12 
          or 13 stars hover about his skull or whatever it is s he has.   s He stands 
          up there for a long time in silence.  It's a big cylinder so big that you 
          can't see the edges from the center.  All you can see are some lights on 
          the walls.  which go down in broken tech lines downwards to a point below.  
          And there aren't really walls because it's just empty space and you can 
          see some of the fake planet sets in there.  fake planet sets the size of 
          the classic earth before the builders ran amok.  And then there is a flash 
          of light like a ring of fire below.  And some time later a huge concussion.  
          The flash is like the sun or an h bomb.  And then there is a lot of waiting 
          some more.  And eventually we see the dark ringed dot below getting bigger.  
          Some more waiting.  Biggeer and bigger until we can see it coming.  Rising 
          up.  A huge iron ball.  a thousand miles across rising slowly up until it 
          reaches the pinnacle of its rise at just about eye level.  No it keeps going 
          up above the godlike being.  no there is a slot cut into it into which the 
          godlike being's gantry structure fits as the ball is going up and then he 
          passes out the bottom of the ball.  And then these giant lazer beams come 
          in from all sides and above and below lighting the iron ball up and 
          compressing it into a marble.  1.7 inches across.  this marble has an odd 
          mirror like structure that seems to warp everything that it passes in front 
          of and seems to have no real surface.  This marble slowly descends down to 
          the godlike being.  And then he cups his hand and it stops.  No it slows 
          down but it's still descending.  And then the godlike being whips into a 
          wicked break set and makes all these funny faces and noises.  And then 
          goes silent and stately again.  All the while holding his hand just under 
          the marble.  which is still slowly descending.  he keeps holding it up 
          until it touches his hand and there is a violent white light explosion 
          vaporizing the godlike being but it's okay because on that level there are 
          no individuals.  so it's more like clipping a toe nail.  and the godlike 
          being's fire fly remains zip at the speed of light into an acression disk 
          which shoots out these blue beams above and below the marble.  which continues 
          descending faster and faster.  it keeps going down until there is another 
          bigger blinding white flash from below and a giant blue beam like a giant 
          3D printer beam that hits a machine floating above with blinking lights 
          and tech baroque and constructs a huge 3D printer which starts printing up 
          more 3D printers which start spinning out the gold and silver spiral space 
          filling mandelbrot like arms of the Jerusalem.  which begins to slowly descend 
          but then it lights up it's million fusion engines on the bottom of the 
          cube 1500 miles per side and the Jerusalem slowly rises up and out into 
          space and hovers there the fusion engines slowly fade to black.  It waits 
          up there for the people and classic animals and plants to board.  Then it 
          collapses the other half of the iron core inside itself into another marble 
          and shoots the small marble at venus.  mercury?  which goes into orbit 
          around venus and starts syphoning gas and dirt and projecting blue beams 
          one towards the Jerusalem and the other in the opposite direction.  And 
          the Jerusalem unfurls giant solar sails and lights up it's million fusion 
          engines again and slowly makes for polaris?  Although at first it looks like 
          it's not moving at all.  Maybe it takes a week to look like it's moving.  And 
          then it folds it's wings back down again and dives for the sun.  Rama like and 
          slingshots around in a tight loop though the corona and back out and back 
          into the blue beam from venus.  And takes off past each planet which crash 
          through its wings which then get rebuilt immediately.  The space filling 
          mandelbrot arms should have an open structure to them that could house 
          living beings and what not.  Like an octopus arm made of open girders so 
          that there are gaps like in a picket fence so you can see though the arms.  
          filagrees.  the arms keep flaming out into sparks and rebuilding themselves 
          in to different space filling shapes.  different topological architectural 
          experiments.  BIG   .  So if you are living in a house built out of one of 
          the spiral arms gold and silver like glass with black streaks of shade then 
          your house will periodically build itself out bigger and bigger and grander 
          and grander and then erase itself and start over.  These dwelling places 
          are constant being made and destroyed in each and every second during the 
          day.  So you just walk along the path and when you see a place you like you 
          just walk in.  Anything you want.  Just imagine it and up it comes.  Brain 
          scans don't you know.  No it's not the end of history.  The old history is 
          forgotten.  like a dream.  this is where history starts.  maybe.  but what?  
          think of something.  ok maybe the hangers on out in the drag web still 
          clinging to the old ways of bad keep trying to climb up the web and get into 
          the Jerusalem and cause trouble.  Why?  Who knows.  They can't seem to help it.  
          They want to turn the whole place dark.  Like a cinder.  To defile it?  To 
          kill it?  Why?  Who knows.  maybe they just like the absence of color ie 
          Black.  they can't sit in an empty room   because if they did they would be 
          torn apart    torn limb from limb.  I don't know.  you make something up.  
          yeah God is crying.  So when the people of bad get their hands on the 
          brain scanners in the Jerusalem they immediately start turning out weapons 
          of mass destruction and blowing the place up.  But as fast as they blow it 
          up it keeps rebuilding itself.  Which makes them really mad.   i don't 
          know.  something.   and this keeps going on and on in different epochs.  
          With different flags and different alliances.  And then there is a place(s) 
          down in the core and out on the surface where fighting is not allowed.  the 
          weapons don't work.  And the combatants just stand there and hate each other.  
          well.   half of them hates the other half.  leave it at that.  comic break.  
          the justice field.  people trying to whack each other and getting whacked by 
          the field.  No free will.  Ok enough high concept.  I want a low concept 
          character driven stories that take place on the Jerusalem.  These would be 
          broken out into separate low budget films that could all use the common 
          Jerusalem technology at low cost since it would already be installed.  And 
          then I want high concept with synthetic beings being constructed out of gold 
          and silver and shade and given life and souls and given a job to do likety split.  
          And then what happens to them.  Out in the drag web old space ships are ion 
          driving around just like in a conventional sci fi bar brawl kling on ball buster 
          ride  going from asteroid to asteroid in the net just like they were little 
          planets.  maybe they fight for democrasy?  make up old style governments and 
          argue and kill each other a lot.   just like old times.  In the Jerusalem 
          the various truth futures forms of headless government reign.  everybody 
          can vote just by wishing it.   There is an infinite amount of space and 
          abilities.  not limitless.  after several generations of time all sorts of 
          weird societies of various different technology styles are built and rise 
          and fall in the Jerusalem.   Maybe people carving an old style of life out 
          of different pockets in the Jerusalem.  There are an infinite number of ink 
          blots and each one is an entire universe.  It's a multiverse.  Maybe they could 
          have a Big Bang in one of them.  The Jerusalem has sex with a mortal and 
          BOOM.  How would the Jerusalem manifest herself.  A tall incredibly busty 
          danielle? curvy venus with skin that changes color moment to moment a huge 
          tierra that keeps changing bigger more garish and then smaller more like 
          high and a 3 mile white downed gauzy train with blue bits that has a life 
          of its own that seems to float at times.  and other times hefts back down 
          to earth.  like a tail.  no.  and then she changes by getting squashed and 
          reformed into a funny little girl.  who keeps changing into something else.  
          I want to dam this mac keyboard make her be on the level of the OS in her.  
          But even more.  She has all people in herself and so she keeps changing and 
          each character is more intense or even in silence than the last.  She can 
          flick her fingers and throw off sparks that fall to the floor new works of 
          Motzart or Beethoven or Einstein.  There is a lonely left behind boy.  Who 
          knows.  He just can't make it.  I don't know what.  He is cut off.  Maybe 
          he is not cut off.  Maybe he is just jealous of other people getting married 
          and having kids and what not in the tech restricted little world he lives in 
          just off the y77th ink blot on a "solid" spiral arm( solid spiral arms are 
          always made with a kind of picaso light super structure that you can see 
          through but the beams in them can come together to make a solid place to 
          build ).   But he's got something.  A spark.  That other people don't really 
          see.  And the Jerusalem values this spark.  And she manifests herself to him 
          when no one else is looking.  he tries to tell the others no doubt.  to brag.  
          or something.  but he can't prove it and she won't let him.dam this dm mac 
          keybord     first she manifests herself to him in all her glory.  And then 
          she morphs down into this funny little girl his own age.  who keeps changing 
          into something else.  and he falls in love with her and she opens herself up 
          to him.  and they have sex.  and BOOM the Big Bang.  and he goes down there 
          and finds various worlds and he finds one suspiciously like earth at various 
          moments in history?  and he tries to tell them that he created them but they 
          kick him down the stairs.  don't want to hear it.  or something.  what else 
          what other deviltry       So if you look at the mandelbrot you see that no 
          where in it except for the ink blots is there anything in it that is solid 
          in any way.  Perhaps this could be included in the spiral arms of the Jerusalem?   
          Perhaps you have to go into one of the ink blots to get to one of these Big Bang 
          universes?  I want characters to be able to live on the spiral arms.  But I 
          also want the spiral arms to be made of nothing.  So you can't live on them.  
          You can only go into an ink blot.  oh poo.  okay so some of the spiral arms 
          are solid and some of them are made of nothing but froth and ink blots.  I 
          think the froth is an infinite number of ink blots that looks like froth.  Or 
          maybe the ink blots could be like a black surface that you can stand on.  And 
          then you can live on the ink blot by piling dirt onto it and that way you can 
          still see the spiral arms and fly around in the Jerusalem.  Or the ink blot could 
          be like a door.  Some one way and some the other.  Maybe solid spiral arms could 
          sprout up out of the ink blots and people could live on those.  But the other 
          spiral arms the ones made out of ink blot infinity you can never touch.  and 
          these can never be completely destroyed by the hangers on of bad.  the vestigial 
          hunters.  the blood lusters.    the not cyclist not vegans.   maybe sometimes 
          they let the hangers on of bad in just so they have somebody to fight with.  
          maybe there could be a Jerusalem movie like baraka where nobody fights and there 
          is no conflict at all.  The end of history.  glenboogle.  A character driven sci

          ( copyright kjell e godø )( 20140302 yyyymmdd ) 1:07 ( ok so when the marble 
          is falling towards the godlike being when the 5 main characters kiev etc are 
          looking at it from a distance it looks like the marble just keeps picking up 
          speed as it falls and strikes the godlike being and vaporizes s heim like a 
          bullet there is a bright white flash and the two blue beams like lasers shooting 
          out of the marble up and down and the marble just keeps going down into the 
          darkness.  But as the marble comes down the godlike being's mind keeps speeding 
          up faster and faster the closer the marble comes so for s heim it seems to be 
          coming down slower and slower until it seems to stop.  nearly.  to reach out 
          and touch a marble.  also there are vast liquid metal machines floating down 
          in a spherical formation around the marble.  smaller ones in close and massive 
          ones further out in two or more shells.  as the marble falls these machines 
          fall with it.  these machines should be interesting topological architectural 
          artistic embeddings of space.  So you should be able to see through them and 
          see the energy flowing within.  go wild.  get topological.  go architectural.  
          i don't want to see any flying potatoes.  if i see one more flying potato i will 
          cut my own heart out and swallow it whole and die a thousand deaths and leave you 
          this veil of tiers to defile as you will.  also there are huge topological 
          contraptions orbiting the earth in spherical shells.  maybe some of them look like 
          fermilab.  but liquid metal so they are constantly changing shape.  and you can 
          see the energies flowing within.  so these orbiting machines each one creates a 
          microscopic tiny marble which then eats the machine that creates it and shoots a 
          hypernova beam of blue particles down at the iron ball floating above the godlike 
          being crushing it down into a marble.  some of these beams plow right through the 
          earth so everybody has to be evacuated first except for the godlike being and a 
          few attendants.  the linked battered hollowed earth  is destroyed by the birth of 
          the Jerusalem.  sort of.  it becomes a twisted broken shell.  the Jerusalem creates 
          another marble and sends it to venus.  It goes into orbit around venus.  Now which 
          way is polaris?  Are they going to polaris or somewhere else?  so it is very likely 
          that the marble's blue beam pointed in the direction that the Jerusalem is going 
          to go is going to hit venus during part of the marble's orbit around venus.  
          and so it is going to cut gashes into venus and throw up a lot of dust and gas 
          which the marble will suck up and turn into a stream of light speed particles 
          pointed at the Jerusalem's solar sails.  after a few thousand years or something 
          there will be nothing left of venus and the marble will keep orbiting the sun 
          in venus's orbit.  the star of the morning will be gone.  The venus marble will 
          also have an entourage of liquid metal machines with visible energy beams flowing 
          around inside of them.  And some will orbit venus pacing the marble and some will 
          stay geosynchronous to venus.  Let's get all 2001 upside the public ass man.   
          maybe it's not possible anymore.  people's attention spans have been reduced by 
          incessant electronic novelty to the point of non existence.  that's why i don't 
          want any mr potato head ships.  liquid metal but not smooth and shiny.  they 
          can have rough edges and the usual techno baroque but they have to keep changing 
          and pulsing and rewriting themselves.  and you have to see the energies sitting in 
          the different parts of them and see that energy come out and be directed to other 
          areas of the machine to generate different effects.  we should be able to watch 
          the machines preparing themselves to do different things.  also there should be 
          lots of little machines running on and flying around the larger ones.  like the 
          liquid metal computer monitors in the latest superman movie.  the orbiting 
          machines should be able to morph like that.  and be able to split up into different 
          pieces and re-hook up into different configurations ) )

          on and janis yells out : HEY!!! - YOU ARE STANDING ON AN INFINITE NUMBER OF 
          SUB-UNIVERSES THERE TOP FLIGHT     And kiev lets out a Yelp as he jumps up and 
          looks down where he was standing.  He was standing part on the ink blot and part 
          off.  and jumps away towards the center of the ink blot and away from the foam 
          that attaches to the edge of the ink blot they are standing on.  and kiev 
          yells out : Well How are we supposed to get off of here?  each ink blot has 
          it's own gravity.  janis says : step lightly.  and xenon says : we fly.  and he 
          imagines a vehicle like a boat.  Once they get away from the ink blot then they 
          float free.  If kiev stepped off the ink blot then he would shrink down and land 
          on one of the microscopic ink blots in the ink blot foam he was stepping onto.  
          and be lost forever.  until Jerusalem could find him again which might not be 
          possible if he shrank down below her maximum level of microscopic resolution.  
          or she could send in a lot of robot scouts in after him to increase the scan 
          resolutions.  the Jerusalem is new so everybody who hasn't assimilated the 
          manuals like kiev since he is a classic human and can't assimilate.  so they 
          have to be careful not to run into any of the foam spiral arms because as they 
          get closer and closer they shrink down and shrink down until they land on or 
          in a mandelbrot ink blot embedded in the ink blot fractal foam.  it's all very 
          high concept.  so how do i clear away all the high concept stuff and get character 
          driven.  how do i get all the technology to fade into the background and just 
          focus on two people in the Jerusalem.  And their day to day lives.  Which 
          technology level.  What do people do in the Jerusalem.  What society.  What 
          organization.  what collectives.  i want to focus here on a small set of 
          characters in like a romance or something.  just on their interactions and 
          the technology of the Jerusalem interacts with them in the back ground.  I 
          don't really know how to make such a story.  dialog.  alls i get are dialog 
          fragments.  like poetry.  disconnected.  can anyone behave badly on the 
          Jerusalem.  do i need that?  somebody in danger of getting kicked off the 
          Jerusalem.  out into the drag web.  thought police with brain scanners that 
          can read your mind.  Jerusalem is reading your mind and she is judging you.  
          if you get too far off the rails for more than 7 times 77 times then you're 
          out.  what if somebody starts getting near that limit.  there could be a 
          little girl out on the drag web who dreams of living on the Jerusalem.  No 
          doubt that would be near automatic but i could put up a bunch of road blocks.  
          maybe the road blocks are character building.  but she doesn't know that.  
          maybe she has to break with her parents and her clan to do that.  can i take 
          a character driven story that already exists and graft it onto the Jerusalem?  
          no action.  all high concepts are in he back ground.  perhaps it is the end 
          of history if you can have anything you want just by wishing for it.  forbidden 
          planet?  could people incorporate rapid fire wishing into their relations 
          with each other?  some of these foreign films don't have any evil characters 
          in them like the japanese film about the woman and her cats.  good and evil?  
          Jerusalem and the drag web?  what happens to society when everybody can 
          have everything they wish for?  up to some large limit?  you have to have 
          people who are evil to a degree that is below some maximum level.  or else 
          people start wishing up weapons of mass destruction.  that is what hell is 
          a set of relatively evil people with infinite abilities like red angels 
          stuck together in a lake.  maybe.  somebody gets the idea of lighting the 
          lake on fire and up she goes.  maybe.  there could be an amish like story 
          but at a higher technology level.  where some of the kids want to move up 
          to a higher level and the local church tries to stop it.  perhaps getting 
          everything you wish for is something that is really hard to handle for certain 
          minds.  if there are no restrictions no boundaries maybe only the trained 
          minds like the monks and the amish can really handle it.  or will people 
          just get bored with everything and go into a coma.  or will all the people 
          who see this movie feel that way probably unable to live on the Jerusalem 
          themselves?  nothing but walking twitch reflexes and lizard brains?  hmm.  
          low budget Jerusalem movies about girls with cats.  a low budget Jerusalem 
          movie about a girl and her cats with the Jerusalem rising up on all sides in 
          the sky.  could that go?  a traditional classic now japanese city in the 
          Jerusalem?  why wouldn't she just fly away?  like the amish were afraid of 
          when the automobile came on the scene?  why wouldn't she just fly away and 
          wander aimlessly?  she would have to look at the Jerusalem up in the sky 
          and consciously decide not to go there.  Or a big high power plasma video 
          screen could fake the classic sky including the heat of the sun.  sprinklers 
          for rain.  and then the Jerusalem would just vanish.  what would being on the 
          Jerusalem do to people's minds.  do they need to have certain restrictions or 
          they just blow apart?  could be.  it seems to happen to the rich i have heard.  
          perhaps people would engage in minute interactions of a subtle nature that 
          wouldn't work in a film.  in a film that was trying to make money.  if you 
          don't care about making money...  could you make a film about somebodies 
          electronic interactions?  you've got mail?  boy meets Jerusalem boy loses 
          Jerusalem boy goes on a quest to get Jerusalem back boy wins Jerusalem boy 
          marries Jerusalem boy finds out Jerusalem is married to 500K other guys.  
          And 100K other women too.  But that's okay because Jerusalem can be in 600K 
          different places all at once.  Still.  He gets jealous.   if nothing bad 
          ever happens to anybody will all the stories be girl cat stories?  could i 
          make it blatant Christian.  Christian Science fiction?  That would get 
          around the lizard brain and twitch response problems with trying to appeal 
          to the usual semi secular semi atheist semi pagan all consumer tv baked 
          basically semi evil sadd audiences.  Yeah, i could make it blatant Christian.  
          maybe.  maybe i should look at some christian Science fiction,  could it make 
          enough money to go.  maybe the animators could make everything in a couple 
          weeks because it's all simple stuff anyway and it wouldn't cost that much.  
          want reality.  but Troll did pretty good with not much money.    what airy 
          day dreams.  enough. ) )

          ( 20140306 yyyymmdd ) 16:41 ( jaycob and 4 others face off against jerusalem in a 
          dull green fluorecent room made of different layers of frosted glass with angled beams 
          of green glowing from within between the beams in the irregular organic triangle gaps a 
          more yellow orange glow like dusk inside of the walls.  jaycob is standing near and to 
          the right of jerusalem who is further away facing him about 20 feet away.  she is very 
          tall and glowing wedding dress like outfit with slowly moving packets of information 
          flowing here and there over it white green.  the four are sitting on bean bag like 
          cushions to jaycob's left and closer to jerusalem than jaycob is.  it might be a large 
          and complex room with a flat glossy floor and a huge grand 100 foot wide staircase 
          going down into whatever behind jaycob.  she offers jaycob a dare( [_]: elaborate ).  
          a dull red slowly glowing dot in the air with a sphere shell of air like 5 or 6 
          inches in radius or diameter with fleeting flashes of weather blasting over it and 
          across it and around it instantaneously in random directions soundless and distant as 
          if in a image of somewhere(s) else at time lapse high speeds barely visible.  subconscious.  
          jaycob : what is it?  jerusalem is silent.  jaycob : what is it?  
          jerusalem :  .  jaycob : hey what is it you dumb broad.  and he points a menacing 
          middle finger at her like a gun and works his body up into a stance a 
          menacing grimace momentarily flashing across his face and holding in anger and low 
          impatience.  jerusalem : it's like a drug.  an involuntary jerk like a subconscious 
          dance rips momentarily through jaycobs body and the others grin back and he grins 
          back at her for the others.  and two of them bust out a malicious momentary guffaw 
          which resolves itself into a low boil snear.   jaycob : wel Hey! drugs are my middle 
          name broad.  bring. it. on.  the dot is about chest level and a few pixels 
          across like a point in space.  dark red slowly glowing.  it has wandered out 
          into the room away from jerusalem and towards jaycob while they were speaking.  
          she blows a kiss and it begins to move towards jaycob.  the dot slowly comes to 
          a stop at arms length in front of him.  ( from now on we see the dot close up 
          through jaycob's eyes we see it through his eyes ) and he looks at it slowly 
          glowing in front of him.  his expression goes a little slack as he looks into it.  
          suddenly the 4 on the cushions near jerusalem perk up.  they look at jerusalem 
          intently focused total on jaycob.  they look at jaycob.  they're expressions 
          go slack and then begin to alarm.  they start to rise up from the cushions.  
          they start yelling.  half at jaycob and half at jerusalem.  and their arms begin 
          to stretch out in both directions.  jaycob doesn't seem to hear them.  they try 
          to rush jaycob but somehow they don't get up.  then they roll over stretched 
          out on the cushions towards jerusalem and stretch their arms out straight 
          towards her with the fingers apart straining like lining up an assault 
          blaster.  and lightning comes out of their fingertips and blows jerusalem's 
          skin off.  she glances at them and her skin grows back and she continues to 
          look at jaycob who is still fixated on the dot.  more lightning and her skin 
          blows off again and near instantly grows back.  she remains calm.  focused.  
          they set to with more murderous intent and her skin blows off and grows back 
          faster and faster.  jaycob slowly begins to lift his left arm up towards the 
          dot.  jerusalem seems to be in a strobe light of skin flying everywhere.  
          unmoved.  unblinking to jaycob.  one of the guys sees jaycob slowly raising 
          up his arm and yells at him and breaks off and the strobe slows down a little.  
          the arm in the forground the guy out of focus into focus in the background on 
          the cushions.  his left index finger begins to extend as his arm comes slowly 
          up.  it bends back and buffets a little as it hits the shell of air.  and then 
          it presses through.  we see jerusalem's eyes filling the screen the skin around 
          them strobing quickly.  each strobe shows the muscles and bones beneath.  going
          faster and faster into a blur.  the eyes are very beautiful like gaga without 
          makeup when they are skinned and like billiard balls when their ice is broken.  
          his finger comes up to the dot slower and slower.  the guy facing jaycob yells 
          NOOOO and breaks off his attack and makes a herculean effort to get up off the 
          couch and makes it miraculous and rushes towards him like an defensive line 
          backer.  the dot melts into his finger like a snow flake and the glow sinks 
          down into his skin on the finger print and sinks down into his finger like a 
          glowing flare sinks down into the sea.  jerusalem slowly closes her eyes and 
          begins to fade.  and then her body explodes splattering all over the walls.  
          the line backer in slow motion hits jaycob in the mid rift and knocks him 
          back into fast motion and they go flying and hit the floor some meters back 
          towards the grand staircase.  and jaycob yells hey!!! and struggles and 
          grabs the arms around him and twists and wrestles them off and rolls over 
          and flips the line backer off and jumps to his feet into a stance and ready 
          to fight.  What the HELL are you doing?  and he looks into his left palm  
          and he looks around the room.  and he wonders where jerusalem went and he 
          recognizes her and he brings his index finger back up and looks at the spot 
          where the dot went in.  and jaycob says : hey what is this stuff.  i don't 
          feel a thing.  jerusalem's remains squidge together like high speed wriggling 
          worm pieces and pile onto each other and pile up into a small monster of flesh 
          which parts up at the top into a wide mouth like opening pointing up to the 
          high ceiling which opens and slobbers gaga gutteral modified like the robot 
          in alien : wait for it ... topological curvature.  and then the mouth 
          collapses under a rain of lightning that splatters it all over the walls 
          again.  jaycob says : topological curvature?  with his face all incredulous 
          still looking at the spot.  the others are all looking at him all of them 
          on deck now and ready for action.  then his face goes slack.  and he looks 
          up out beyond the walls.  and he says : oh my god ...

              overcast winter afternoon while coming home from a travesty of missdirected legal injustice 
              stopping on the grey country house hill where the dressing room trailers once sat just 
              north up the hill from the main drag )( east of the steeple? )

          ( i was staring into the public past and she was staring into me from 35 yards down the 
              hill in the middle of the street looking up at me in a copy of the black cone coat but 
              i didn't know it yet )
          ( i was looking back in time at the spot where the stumbling block girl locked back at 
              me for 7.5 seconds from 13 yards when i was young and pretty enough for girls to do 
              that often and then she said something about LA to someone who was popping up in 
              front of her )( not my world )( like wanting to step into the screen but in no way 
              able or even really wanting to do so )( too alien )( maybe she was locking me because 
              she had seen the twin dirt patches on the seat of my white pants i saw later when i 
              took them off at home that I must have gotten from sliding down a steep dirt hill 
              in the woods trying to circle around for a better look at Dick Van Dyke )( it was my 
              first real life look at movie star pretty )
          ( when i looked up i saw her she was wearing a copy of the black cone coat she had a 
              light oval face and thin blonde hair in a pony tail and pants? Light colored high 
              water pants? With black flat shoes? or were they black pants? Ok i will let them 
              be black because that's just the kind of mood I'm in we locked for 3.5 seconds 
              from a distance of 35 yards? 25 yards? 15? and then she turned violently in a 
              well practiced move maybe her signature move and she walked quickly away across 
              the street and turned left apon making the far sidewalk across the T intersection

              news group in 2000 or something )( or was it on the phone to Scott )( or was it in 
              person to Scott )( weirder and weirder )
          ( i followed her at a much slower pace but never caught sight of her again as I walked 
              back to my car getting my thick woolen birken socks soaked in the light brown slush 
              puddles she had some how walked on without getting wet )( I remember being amazed

          ( copyright kjell e godø )( 20140422 yyyymmdd )( 17:27 Seattle )( wild architecture several 
          light years high and continually doing advanced topological things to space and time is 
          going off throughout this movie  It is a travel movie so there is constant motion  It may 
          start on a planet in one of the thumb print universes in the Jerusalem  And then it goes 
          out into the Jerusalem but it is a strange Jerusalem They seem to land in a city several 
          times with the architecture getting wilder and bigger expanding out into space and doing 
          weirder and weirder things to them as they keep going There is gravity but the masses 
          seemingly floating up there whole landscapes curving around and defying Get some topologists 
          to help Use the alpha to glass Some times they are out in the country but the country is 
          winding up into the sky And flat does not describe what is going on at all It is a new 
          married couple doing the traveling But they seem to pass through all different ages from 
          one hour to the next  They never explain this  As they keep going friends join up with 
          them and then depart again A cloud of them are in similar motion and they touch each other 
          as they keep going along There is some kind of media that they use to talk Maybe it becomes 
          clear that their speech patterns are steganographic with everything having at least two 
          meanings a light and a dark and some others And they just keep going Like a French movie 
          But the science fiction just keeps getting more and more intense but each new thing that 
          would normally fill it's own movie just comes and then goes again And these things keep 
          piling up and piling up through wilder and wilder architectures If these architectures 
          are the sonnets then Syd Mead is the letter $a ( no offense Syd Mead is the top but i want 
          to go way way beyond his this And i want him to do it He is the top ) The couple just take 
          every new thing in stride There happen to be several copies of themselves that they keep 
          slipping back into when they get close enough to to a thumb print to pick up the subspace 
          signal or other It's not dark It's not dark But now and then and more and more towards the 
          end they keep running into things that are too much for them and they wind up rebelling 
          against them and regrouping back to the good old days which to the audience looks like the 
          far distant future So there isn't a big conflict I don't think The characters just talk So 
          it's like a play But the architecture keeps changing and this keeps a continually advancing 
          sense of wonder building Like Alice in wonderland Maybe there is a brief out and out conflict 
          at the end but we see that it is the technology interacting with them and how it makes them 
          behave towards each other that is the key maybe they decide just to shut it all down and 
          live in a cabin on a new thumb print they create then and there and then dive into and then 
          it goes on some more for a while the terminator is not dead And then they wind up asleep on 
          the beach in some beach chairs all three or four of them  and the sun is either coming I 
          think the sun is coming up But I don't mean anything by it It's just a star rising above 
          the horizon on the planet they are on So no big concepts No aliens or technologies trying 
          to blow up the world yet again that have to be killed off before the end It's just two
          people or sets trying to work it out Oscar ? Perhaps it would prove that the only way a 
          science fiction movie is ever going to win it is you have to take all the action out How 
          about she is way more powerful than him and this makes him insecure but he keeps kissing 
          her all the time in public and it's okay in the end He has no power His macho just falls 
          flat and this is very troubling But it's okay because she's Jewish Italian and if he tried 
          to put that one over on her anyway it would set off a Herculean struggle for exactly who 
          is going to wear the dresses in the house like Sher and Sonny he just doesn't get it and 
          she just doesn't get it either the whole key to the problem is that she is the one wearing 
          the dresses all the time and That Has Got To Stop So boy loses girl and then lets her go 
          briefly not too long and then he quickly realizes what is happening that she is slipping 
          away well that part of it anyway and he chases her and keeps going breaking down barrier 
          after barrier inside of himself until he finally wins her back shucks it all off all the 
          hot late 20 somethings he was fighting off with his barrette spawns a copy to take care of 
          that and rejoins up with her vowing revowing and he gives up his striving to be over top 
          of her and suddenly finally if clicks in her and it all comes flooding back and makes 
          sense in a moment not too late An his copy gets busy with th late 20 somethings And what 
          does he have to die then? No A symbolic death Or one of his copies shows up to take his 
          place No deaths Symbolic only So it's a Sher and sonny or Gaga and gighter no violence 
          no save the world in the knick of time lots more science than usual but it's everyday 
          science as they use it and it affects them in daily life and lots more architecture and 
          lots of topology and lots of movement as they keep traveling but no shooting no ducking 
          for cover no explosions unless it is to regroup from a stinging retort And perhaps they 
          have powers to shape matter at will and these forces we see them use both consciously 
          and unconsciously in their conversations most people talk with their hands but this couple 
          talk with all the matter and space and energy around them We see it manifest in the air 
          around them and we get it before they do We see the subconscious threads they don't seem 
          to Perhaps the subconscious stuff happens behind walls that they can't see but we do Also 
          the architecture of space and time should mirror and describe what is going on between 
          them But with counter points to mess up the waves Maybe there is this other guy competing 
          who realizes he doesn't really care about her anymore but is actually more involved with 
          him from a revenge angle he has fallen in love with him and his downfall and she is just 
          a means to that end even if he wanted to stop the madness he can't because of everyone 
          egging him on in his sect Or something Cross currents and noise Maybe after all he winds 
          up using the guy for good his own good and redirects the sect into other bigger things  
          Maybe he gets captured and the video links and playbacks start rolling showing him how 
          far is the fall and catching him up on everything he missed but it's only a copy and the 
          copy somehow gets loose and all hell breaks loose  Water tight doors have to be put 
          into use  And minions cut off  which doesn't happy the other minions too much  Before 
          it all gets tamped down And the losses tallied  Steganographic under currents  Multiple 
          channels at once overt and not hidden but hidden to them but not to us It solves the 
          problem of talk movies not moving enough It has lots of science going off louder and 
          louder but no violence and no deaths Threats But no deaths Comedy Romance Drama Science 
          fiction And Atheist and NonAtheist Religion And the battle of the sexes And an Edgar 
          revenge subplot or three Maybe it should come in two 3 hour parts that open one right 
          after the other Why not Just shoot them both and There must be a reason why it is never 
          done this way But from here I can't see it Maybe the Sonny character knows he is being 
          watched by the sect all the time but the Sher doesn't and can't because it is against 
          her religion so everything he says is meant for both of them at the same time And it 
          turns out that they are just a show on some network somewhere or other but she doesn't 
          know it and he doesn't know just how big the show is But the show hides it And then it 
          turns out it was just a little show But then it gets revealed even bigger again It keeps 
          switching So all of this is going on at the same time as they are having it out And 
          going from one end of time and space and technology to the other Once the Jerusalem 
          is set up then you can use it over and over again for stuff like this )

          idea from yesterday.  But when I start snowing myself and I can't stop it I just want to 
          delete it.  So I did.  Maybe I can recreate it better.  here later.
          Sometimes I know it's all just a big shaving cream con heart bleeding out of a card dripping 
          from a pen of casino suits and these are all just actors.  in my head.  if they were real 
          I would be scitzophrenic by now.  I would be gone.  but they never seem to actually get 
          here.  sometimes I think they are benevolent.  and if I knew that they were a fraud.  
          we'll.  maybe I would go along with it anyway.  I like the side effects.  today.  they 
          are just actors in a dream.  I think I can control them.  they don't look evil to me.  
          the evil is walled off today.  and if I can wrap this up now that will actually be true.  
          if I can't then it is controlling me and I don't like that.  but I am a Boy Scout and 
          that means I have to know all the possibilities I can know and lean as fast as I can 
          into the one that seems to be happening now.  and always trying to be ready to deflect 
          a 180.  so all you have to do is play the actor.  and you will be safe.  but if you come 
          too close to where if you were lying I would be dead then I don't like that.  because 
          I don't believe you.  but I'm willing to go along with it up to a point.  then the 
          ball is in your court.  and I'm waiting for your serve.  and I am trying to be ready 
          for anything.  and if anything is coming too close then I will act. ) )

          ( 20140507 yyyymmdd )( 7:36 Seattle )( that wasn't too bad.  times up.  the green haired 
          girl is fascinating.  she doesn't look angry but her eyes are filled with 6 lights 
          of s.  but divided up into 2 sets of trinity.  either she is sick to her stomach or 
          she is green with envy.  I think it is sick.  she looks rye.  she has these black lines 
          in her face.  three black lines so that's another trinity.  I don't know what they 
          are.  maybe plastic explosives.  in the shape of goggles or boobs.  boobs are in the 
          eyes of the beholder.  like : hey my stomach is as flat as my chest is what do you 
          want.  silly cone?  no.  I don't much like silly cone.  I like real fat.  but if it's 
          not there then it's not there.  maybe she's some kind of Jane air type like my girl.  
          her body is holy when it comes to knives and besides the expense is a blast pheme 
          and she doesn't care about and can't conceive what she might benefit if she was to 
          relent.  she can't know what would really happen.  "but it's not real"  oh b last.  
          of course it's not real you idiot.  but it doesn't matter.  I know from years 
          decades of daily day by day hour by hour minute by minute experience that IT 
          DOESNT MATTER.  IF YOU ONLY REALIZE ONE TRUTH IN THIS LIFE THAT YOU DIDNT 
          ALREADY KNOW LET IT BE THIS : IT DOESNT MATTER.  IT DOESNT MATTER.  IT DOESNT 
          MATTER.  when those curves of a perfect cleavage hit my brain it doesn't matter 
          if they are two dimensional scrawls on a crumpled out scarp of legal pad.  my 
          brain lights up like a Christmas tree and then bursts into flame.  it's a fetish.  
          that's all there is to it.  I don't much like frontal.  it has to be pushed together 
          and up.  and overflow out the sides.  and it has to cleave.  it's very specific.  
          it knows what it wants.  it knows what receptors it has got.  up the yin yang.  
          in spades.  and all the ones that it doesn't.  got.  and never ever has.  got.  
          but if you.  yeah?  I'm old enough to be her father no matter how old she is so 
          this is just a rift in a day dream of what if.  but if she would just relent.  
          and no. there is no way I could get her to buy it.  dam.  oh crap.  I think she's 
          got it but I just couldn't sell it.  she would just cut me off and there would 
          be no way in.  after.  but I'm telling you I would n't be able to keep my eyes 
          or my hands off her.  but she just can't conceive what that would mean.  it 
          might change everything.  if only.  she would relent.  oh but it's impossible.  
          hopeless.  how could I make her see.  it's a fetish damm it.  why not use it?  
          I do.  every dog blammed day.  and that is what you are missing out on.  think 
          about it.  try to imagine.  every day I imagine you like I want you and you get 
          none of it.  every day.  sometimes two or three times a day.  my brain is 
          getting it but not you.  if only you knew.  so pitiful.  standing on to the 
          virgin Klondike mother of all gold rushes and you have been for years and you 
          don't even know it.  pouncing around like you know what is going on when it's 
          all just being wasted.  has been wasted.  so bad for so long.  it just staggers 
          the imagination.  what could have been.  "I don't care."    fuck. ) )

        ( 20140509 yyyymmdd )( 6:48 Seattle )( i probably shouldn't say this i don't want to say this but I can't 
        stop myself saying this but i feel like i have just been scratched socked and hip butted by a girl.  ( in 
        Norway i got hip butted by a girl in Horten i think.  then i tried to asks her to dance but she instantly 
        said no vehemently.  which crushed me.  because I ok have it your way I knew I couldn't talk to her.  
        I think now that she wanted me to push harder.   maybe.  probably.  she was a player anyway.  just 
        serialising.  at the end of the night as we were all waiting to leave she across looked at her friend to 
        the right of me and looked at me and shrugged her shoulders.  just a tad disappointed.  well what the 
        hell am I supposed to do.  I remember thinking it but in a vague unformed fog of younger.  I can't 
        speak to you.  if I open my mouth the pedantics will start flowing out.  the too polite to mount any 
        offensive that might work pedants.  so I was stuck.  again.  forever.  fabulous sweet whipped creamed 
        Sunday cherry right in front of my nose and I have no tongue to reach out a lick.  just out of.  so I 
        just stood there on the other side of the covered walk stone arch drive way thing in the disco tech 
        looking every now and to her then my thigh still soar from where she let me have it.  wow she nearly 
        broke my leg.  it felt like.  sort of.  ok if I knew what having a broken leg was really like I probably 
        wouldn't mention that but it still hurt hours later.  she really let me have it.  I was just standing 
        there leaning on the wood looking down at the people dancing right along with everybody else up there 
        and POW.  WHAT?!!  omg     THAT HURTtt     nothing     a few minutes later they both walk   I find her 
        again     I ask    she says no with a little well practiced cut to it looking me right in the eye looking 
        into me assessing me in an instant      then turning back    cutting me off over and out      huffing?
        waiting?     I can't remember    no huffing   no   she was too strong and cool to ever huff  etc ) 
        Kiev: ok     aurora : you think your going to cut me?   what about you?   what are you going to cut?
        Kiev : hey.   I will go under the knife in a second ( with my boys surrounding the building but ) no 
        hesitation what so ever.  if it means.  if it means. ) )<---[ dowager gives the surveyor working man 
        a talking to he is looking at her like he knows who she is and can't believe it or like she is totally

          but here goes
          ok so aurora is this sadist super princess queen of a host of two faced sad it's minions
          Kiev stop that whatever Kiev is the head of an angel army smaller than hers fighting 
          her every day tooth and nail with explosions and car chases and fingers flying the 
          whole entire catastrophe
          but every day when the sun rises above the horizon they meet on neutral ground in a 
          her outlying towering Venetian 360 castle black
          and go crazy
          just total bonkers
          and he just can't stop because she has got him right in by the fetish is
          she had it constructed special
          and he just can't leave her alone
          but he keeps trying
          but she won't budge
          he keeps trying to get her to soften her DNA
          but she dials it more sad it's so
          blast it he gets all worked up
          but she won't change
          just an eight of an inch
          come on
          what would it hurt
          just an eighth
          no
          ok eventually she is alone having killed thousands of greens that day
          just sitting there
          and she does dial it on eighth of an inch towards him
          and eventually she dials it all the way and becomes angel
          but she never lets him know that
          she starts faking the killings
          using actors and video
          and he is fighting her day after day harder and harder but she doesn't seem to notice
          and that is somewhat disappointing 
          eventually he sees a tiny clue
          and the whole thing unravels in his head
          and he knows she is shamming him and has been for a long time
          but he only pauses
          and every her orgasm she screams bloody murder and whips off her wig
          and he kisses the lemon spiked nipple painted there each day
          and then kisses her and she tastes the lemon
          Kiev : why don't you just grow hair why don't you just mod your DNA?
          no
          aurora : you want hair ?
          Kiev : no
          you know I don't notice what is on top of your head I never get up that far
          I like a different hair each day anyway
          aurora : then stop
          day break
          he is waiting looking way down and out and shielding a hand
          a rustle
          another new dress to try out
          zow
          she likes to hit him right where it hurts
          and he bursts into flame
          every single time
          and she says : why don't You Mod YOUR DNA
          you keep complaining how inconvenient It all am
          how you never get any work done anymore
          Why Don't You just relax
          Kiev : at least I don't have to hurt any one
          except you
          aurora : speak for yourself or back at you ok fix this this stinks I can't say this
          so eventually she sees a tiny clue and realises that he knows that she is shamming him
          and he has known for a long time
          and this entire war was just for show
          but she only pauses
          and eventually they are like two actors playing different parts
          with different crews
          and she plays an angel 
          and then shyly looks at him
          playing
          and he plays an devil right back at you

          the one we have now where everyone hides knives always at the ready to carve up 
          anyone's truth almost immediately.  concealing weapons so as to subvert defences 
          until the most opportune moment.  lies that conceal weapons until the most 
          opportune moments.  pretty words of reconciliation from Henry the eighth.  drop 
          your weapons everything is fine.  we love you.  all is forgiven.  come on in.  
          an entire culture of surface smiles and painted goodness that hide tombs and 
          dead men's bones.  and all the media that feeds on that status curling it up 
          into a jillion fractal riddles smoking it's simplicity into a mystery of complexity.  
          here is your goodness look at it your Ronald McDonald and here are the hints of 
          the tombs and dead men's bones inside.  and here is you not knowing what's inside 
          and here is us showing you.  by drips and drabs.  so you won't know.  until it's 
          too late.  and here is us showing the satanic brush stokes that have been 
          embedded into the institution of Jesus.  by all of you.  even without knowing 
          what you were doing because you were too stupid to know any better and what 
          would happen when you made him into an institution in a land where not lying 
          instantly targets you for a prey and gets you crucified.  even today.

          was created in a bathtub one day to    
          Amish land is part of a historical continuum where the further to the west 
          you go along the map the further into the future you go    but each place 
          you stop at is frozen in time at a certain year      or even a certain day
          or even a certain minute     or even a certain second

          Most places like cities exist in a certain year and all the media is from 
          that year when they get to the end of the year then everyone can memory 
          wipe them selves back to the beginning of the year and everything starts 
          over from the beginning of the year and tiny robots tear all the stuff 
          built that year and put up all the stuff that was torn down       if 
          someone wants to keep their memory they can try to do the year over but 
          better this time       no one has to age unless they want to or they can 
          age backwards 1 year and start over        if they want to move on to 
          the next year they can move to the next copy of the city directly to the 
          west or if there is no room for that then on one of the other artificial 
          earths inside the earth they can find a copy of the city from a later year
          if you want you can join a historical society where everyone's brains are 
          connected and people try to reenact 
          the lives of people who actually lived and say every thing they said and 
          do everything they did and try to reenact as actors in a city wide play
          these historical people are written up by the society writes up the 
          dialog like they might have said and comb through the brain archives to 
          try to figure out the most authentic way       other people can just wing it

          some places where famous or notable things happened might reenact 
          something that only lasts a few minutes       and then it rewinds back 
          to the beginning and replays maybe with the same people acting it out or 
          with some different people acting it out       some plays of it might 
          stick to the script and others might try to deviate          since everyone 
          has all the scripts recorded in the databases in their heads it is easy for 
          them to say the lines and learn how to act it out by experiencing what
          famous actors in that role experienced while playing it out

          there is a city where people are just improvising musicals all the time 
          singing and dancing large or small musical numbers that only happen once 
          or keep getting replayed totally on the fly and orchestrated by the 
          script wriiters and musicians in the common brain sphere that everyone 
          inhabits there      the people in that city are devoted to improvisation
          it takes a short while to get up to speed with the aid of brain apps

          there is a Vietnam reenactment where you keep going west and get to the 
          end of the war

          so they camp for a few days with some soldiers      who have forgotten 
          that they are in a simulation and no amount of arguing can wake them up
          and they just sit around the camp fire and talk       for three days
          and then       they get the word      but Kiev or Vix or Vix screws it 
          up and they wind up Asian       and after the battle       they spend 
          another 3 days in a Charlie      in a Viet cong camp     sitting around 
          the camp fire        and the Americans start breaking cover arguing with 
          the Viet cong     but they can't break cover because they look Vietnamese
          just an idea     the idea is to slow it down and just let the actors do 
          what they do       this could take up one episode in the cloud      if 
          anyone wants it     be my guest

          if you die in the war you can decide if you want to be resurrected or not

          why does this vacuuming always take so long      I don't see the piles of dirt on the hard wood

          Aurora is Kiev's new wife ( I will stick it in a market and let you all 
          mangle it   I mean perfect it ) but she catches this brain virus that 
          synthetics get      and the virus is called Vix       and Aurora becomes 
          Vix       and then she knows she is synthetic       and that drives her 
          crazy      she becomes subject to extreme bouts of volatility and extreme 
          calm which never last       raychell Racheal but when they meet Jerusalem 
          lg gl ory she gets the power to throw off the virus once and for all
          and then she has to decide if she wants to be rid of her disease
          maybe she gets rid of the bad parts       but the Vix virus negotiates and 
          so the bad parts can come back at random times but not for long Aurora gets

          so they get up to the present day

          just prior to the singularity

          up to now the audience has always known what is going to happen next 

          road trip

          but now it no longer knows

          so we get to the chase episode      where they go so far so fast that they 
          run right off the edge end of the world

          and find out that the world is a half sphere inside of the earth 
          and is only a simulation

          so they fall off of it

          and find their way to the true surface of the earth       and then 
          they have to ride across the inside of the surface of the earth to 
          get to where the Jerusalem is       and get out to her to board her
          to stow away

          and almost meet the beings who have been fighting over them

          but every time the beings try to meet them      they thwart them     no meeting

          they almost meet the being called vix who created the virus that 
          infected Aurora     but not quite

          they see the truthfutures markets where they are being traded

          where they see the Jerusalem

          and stow away somehow         slow       now they know that their 
          every move has been watched by this crowd of higher beings      or 
          is it just one       or is it millions        they can't tell         
          so how do they react to that       do they trust these beings
          or do they start trying to defend themselves against them      
          do they start speaking on multiple channels       can they help it

          I'm sure there are lots of people who can figure this stuff out 
          better than me     maybe you?

          but I get final say

          and then meet her

          and go on a quest?     to cure Vix?       I don't want one of these 
          break neck quests where nobody has time to breath      I want a slow 
          quest       like in a war     long periods of slow       not going 
          anywhere not doing anything       really slow       slow        
          punctuated by short blasts of trouble breathing        and in those 
          slow parts         the director of screamers     got it wrong     
          that long walk was the best part of the movie     it was not to long

          ( copyright kjell e godø )( 20140609 yyyymmdd )( 17:36 Seattle )( What 
          if zero or more of the Jerusalem episodes ( parallel sequels ) was similar 
          to Baraka or Samsara.  Just let the renderers go bananas.  Anything you 
          can imagine is fair game.  Rules : ( RuLES.!? ) Rules : 1. No caves.
          ok so what do these rules these architectural Ten Commandments lead us to.
          There can never be more 
          than 3 walls in any one place.     There should always be unimaginable 
          topological complex mind bending space everywhere such as would make 
          frank lloyd wright weep.    No caves. .1       You should be able to 
          see everywhere else from everywhen else.   Gardens up in the air.    Wild 
          fractal plants that repeat themselves up and out and into the distance.
          Make the architecture be a character.  Like in Japan.   So the camera is
          floating and moving through these spaces.      Spaces that make people
          stick together because divorce means they would have to leave this place.
          And we see faces.    All sorts of unimaginable faces.  So real.    That 
          tell something about who they are.       And we see the neutron stars 
          and black holes that power the place.   floating up in these vast sort 
          of spherical but more complex with spires and conduits rising up to direct 
          the energy.     the crab in its entirety       You can see the energy 
          flowing through the fractal conduits and circulating outward into the 
          capillaries.   Like that Cosplay Tron prom dress and girl. on pinned.com.  
          WOW.   with the neon in the toes.  zow w w      Jerusalem is like that 
          only infinitely complex.  with blue lights up her dress.    So once you 
          get inside the Jerusalem it's infinitely vasti in there so go all out.
          And combine the big spaces with the Mandelbrot kind of thing.    the
          bigger you get the further out you get the more it looks like the 
          Mandelbrot baroke.    Large places with intimat spaces but no walls.   
          and gravity going every which way like in MC Escher.        Maybe these 
          spaces and 4 5 6 ... dimensional spaces that we fly through can wind up 
          in other episodes.  that's called reuse.              hoaaaa fuck me
          they tell me I got to let evil in           blast.         not in this 
          episode this episode is strictly national geographic       before it got 
          corrupted.     so there is this möbius looking group of three teens in 
          one of these morphing morning         it's always either early spring 
          morning or late dusk in Jerusalem.    ok sky is blue but in Jerusalem 
          the sky has invisible vector fields going through it and directing the 
          space in all sorts of unexpected ways.    intimat spaces that formed up 
          around them.    space forming up into couches only partly xpvisible.     
          very seusian no.   a taste of seusian.   let topology be and Mandelbrot 
          and etc etc etc be your guide.    and strange translucent forms and 
          shapes form up between them glowing up from blue arc cores that spin and 
          transform inside out and back again.   As they speak they create what 
          they are speaking about in the air and all around them rippling out 
          wards into the light years.      they turn into the characters they 
          speak of and act it out.    they suddenly spark into an improvised 
          number    and you can sort of tell by the irregular pauses that they 
          are making all this stuff up on the spot.      another Mozart cantata
          never seen the light of day before and now gone never again will.
          So like ruz Kiev as a Amish kid from fake authentic earth       ok so
          maybe         ok so       a little bit older?      or   what       hmm.
          running out.   is running out.        he is trying to interact with
          these kids who were spawned by the creation of Jerusalem.     these 
          möbius looking kids with the jester clothes that are not quite there 
          on their bodies their bodies are the clothes and the clothes are their 
          bodies and you can see through them moment to moment in different ways.
          what if we made it really realistic and totally Jerusalem at the same
          time.      so you think you are in a doc standing in front of the
          pyramids you can see the pores and smell the thick layers of mundane
          but now you realise you are in the Jerusalem and it totally freaks you
          out this combination of the Jerusalem and the mundane both going 
          infinitely maxed        at the same time          and keep changing 
          and relayering according to their thoughts.       so one episode is 
          just a conversation like my dinner with Andre but infinitely complex.
          and in the Jerusalem.      And part of the conversation is a topological 
          proof or statement or algebraic topologic thing grafted onto a story.   
          And when you get to the end of the story you get to the end of the proof.
          The theory of relativity.     So there are companion episodes that go
          through all the details starting from the ground up or hyperlinking all
          the way down that you can get if you are interested to know.   the full
          catastrophe.   the mind of E      it should be graphted onto some kind 
          of Jerusalem story so the story informs the theory and the theory informs 
          the story.     and they talk about it.    they express it with the 
          time and space and light and dark and sound and silence around them.
          they take on the different characters        and the girl becomes Vix
          and shows Kiev what is going to happen to him      without telling anyone
          not Kiev not the audience no one       but then in another episode the
          whole Kiev Vix thing starts happening        and what it does to Kiev.
          as he is watching it unfolding and remembering.   and it solves some 
          piece of the proof.     of something.         and glory saves him at 
          the last second        after his death        or not      you could 
          get lost into there if you want to go down that journey that khan 
          journey.        so one whole episode is just Kiev and these three 
          möbius kids conversing in extemporaneous music and light and theory 
          going everywhere right there and every when right at the speed of thought.
          plays within plays within plays.      and then they trip out to the 
          place where each musical only plays once and they make it up as they
          go singing and dancing and warping the fabric of space and character
          all new all the time no spectators.      we're is the pain       if
          there is no pain there is no story          no pain           a 
          conversation             mundane         yeah but if we are not staring
          down the throat of death we don't know where we are.          maybe
          they visit pain        the long echos of distant pain.        what
          is it to be human.          can you be human without pain.       can
          you be human without eating someone.s cow life.       vegan.       
          is this going to be an infinite budget mundane.         what do they 
          talk about.          can the story of the Jerusalem be grafted onto 
          the theory of relativity and topological curvature.     like that 
          guy      from before      the glory sank down into his finger like a
          red dot           can we graft the story of Jerusalem onto the story
          of topological curvature.     and lead people into that whole thing
          so if people actually go there and we  take them in other episodes and
          games or what then they can finally know what he was saying when he said
          oh      my    god       maybe they visit pain going back to earth and
          see the people and all the connections and combinations like rays
          coming out of everyone some light some black and try
          and each ureika is another piece in the puzzle.        maybe it's too
          much.           glory    lets herself be trashed           no
          I don't want to go there again    yet   yet    yet again        glory
          lets herself be trashed      in one episode     like the time bandits
          to flesh out this whole pain thing          and then she cleans it up
          when all is lost      at the end       and we see time and space warp
          into the plot       on the way down a black hole )

          ( copyright kjell e godø )( 20140610 yyyymmdd )( 15:44 Seattle )( I 
          finally figured out something about Kiev.    Kiev is Amish and so he 
          is trained never to defend himself.  He believes it.  He wants it.  And 
          that is easy in the Amish lands.  but when he goes out there beyond 
          the walls then he gets tested.   I don't know how.   I see a short 
          guy in a group who gets off on taking him down.   so is he silent?
          does he talk?  what does he say?   does he move?  does he just stand
          there?   so he gets no respect because none of them know or care 
          anything about what he is doing.  does he look down or does he look 
          them right in the eye.  does he change what he does?  does it turn 
          into a joke?  does it get humorous.   if one of them is getting his 
          rocks off by the beatings than can they ever end?  do the rest of them 
          stop it or are they all getting off on it.  so they pee on the red 
          scooter.  and they force a race but the red scooter won't go.  so they 
          pee on her again.  when they are leaving then she goes and they turn 
          around and get knocked off their feet by the shock wave.  but they 
          can't see her.  just a blur of dust.  on the horizon.  more later.  
          at some point he gets forced to defend himself and then it becomes 
          apparent that he was not standing down all the time because he 
          couldn't do it.  he does it really well.  in the movie.  and this 
          is kind of shocking.  something to do with Vix.   but she has a 
          trump card.    herself.      he's winning and winning and winning 
          but in the end she has a trump card.        either that or she 
          infiltrated the government. bah.   maybe...     and it turns out 
          somebody was helping him win.     so it wasn't even him alone.       .... ) )

          can create question market values for each of the questions they 
          want answered about relentless.  and their readers can buy and 
          sell these questions.  for free using free future bucks.  but 
          you only get a billion unless you cheat.  we will try to shame 
          the cheaters or something.  and each buy and sell can have a market 
          forum on the chart where their readers can comment on all the trades.  
          they can make the questions efficient so their readers can trade back 
          in time.  the price searches can average into one whole index or 
          cancel each other so only the last trade matters.  there can be an 
          infinite supply of the question or a finite supply so that it can 
          be cornered.  so each new piece of info coming into the market 
          authorities cause the readers to trade and back in time if the 
          stranger desires it and people can comment on the trades right at 
          the place on the chart where the event happened and you can see the 
          chart's reaction.  so hopefully this would amplify the strangers 
          story and make it have more of an effect on relentless.  and if 
          relentless got addicted to TF product real time chart based 
          ratings first we do it without their permission then when they 
          shut us down we try to inject our patent into them.  once we have
          their attention.  and never sell out to them.  and then we can 
          zap them when they are zapping others and get some leverage which 
          can be focused back into the markets.  more later. ) )

          ( fail funnyfarm ( neighbor's powerful wifi is gumming it up ? 
          it was going fine I set the wifi password on the K unit and some 
          other thing(s)(?) and was checking the wifi hookup to the iPad 
          several times and suddenly the K unit went missing from the list 
          of wifi on the iPad all the wifi that are usually there disappeared 
          and there was only this HOME-99F7 which is even more powerful and 
          higher on the iPad list of wifi at the top actually higher than our 
          own DSL wifi which is only 4 or 5 feet from this iPad so you would 
          think it would be top on the list but it's second to this HOME-99F7 
          thing which must be really powerful in order to do that.  Why do 
          they need so much power and how do they get it?  briefly a wifi named
          "funnyfarm" showed up on the iPad wifi list after the Kingston unit 
          disappeared and then funnyfarm disappeared also so there is now just 
          our wifi and this HOME-99F7 left.  So this leads to the Kingston 
          unit is defective or I set it up wrong or perhaps this HOME-99F7 or 
          this funnyfarm had something to do with it? did they listen to the 
          password being typed into the wifi and then take over the K unit 
          and put some virus on it to shut it down?  or are they just 
          overwhelming the K unit's channel 11 with static?     99F7    
          is 6 sets of 3 fuck 7     so it's a bunch of 6 good trinity angels 
          that fuck 7 = god, so it's 6 = satan little Christian angels or 
          wolves in sheep clothing fucking up the christian.   so i could 
          stand in for the christian since that links to me since i am one.  
          so it's satan F christian.  perhaps they were ready to do it?  
          waiting? waiting a long time?  waiting a horribly long time?  
          waiting a vastly mind bendingly nauseatingly loooong time?  
          were they previously set up?  if so then they must have known

          as good as blade runner because you know what even though I have 
          already seen it somewhere between 47 and 747 times because I used 
          to watch a piece of it every day before going to the u with my brother 
          and polite James for 8 years I still am not tired of it it's like I'm 
          seeing it for the 27th time all over again so how do I do that
          son I think we need to step back here for a minute
          here it comes         we need to think about our demographics here
          demographics         yes and besides blade runner is so old and 
          soooo slooooow nothing ever happens in it the kids are going to 
          devolve back into their twitch devices if you try to achieve that
          demographics       yes
          and how       I want you to channel fish ok think about fish what
          does a fish want to see ok      fish
          yes now it's your job to entertain these fish a great big school
          of fish      fish       yeah now your getting it I want you to keep
          them from clicking anything on or flipping anything open or swiping
          anything back to life for 75 minutes do you think you can do that
          why not make it 80        ok now you're cannibalising consession
          sales look I think you get the picture think fish how do I keep
          a fish occupied for 75 minutes and how do I keep those fish from
          realising that they just got robbed ok        fish       that's
          right now go back and get me something that will conform to your
          demographic        fish       you've got it I'm looking forward
          to see what you come up with        give me a solid twitch design
          with a Mesmer index of 6.68 or more and we will do beautiful things

          shots to disable an ak unlimited bezerk at them not spinning anyone 
          to some degree and how that stabs and jives the always watching 
          each other group the bird herders the elites and I wonder what 
          would happen if the elites did the same and I wonder what would it 
          take to make that happen but most of all I think I cry this time 
          because this time I know a simple nothing that they didn't have to 
          die that would have saved them all with nothing nothing like shifting 
          your weight from one foot to the other it's nothing but it's hidden

          dies everyone has to die in the movie there's no getting around

          enough to foil the RPGs but low enough to maintain cover in tight
          circular patterns maybe even just spinning in place at times , 
          the soldiers should have headphones so they can hear each other 
          but not the bullets or explosions not so they go deaf from it , 
          they should have wrist phones with maps in them or just detailed 
          maps stuck to their forearms with a small compass thing that shows 
          which way they are pointed in the map embedded and a small 
          magnifying glass around their necks or stuck to the map , GPS , 
          the birds should just shoot anything on the roof tops , where was 
          the air cover , they owned the roof tops , who's idea was that , 
          one bird on one side firing towards the breach and one bird on 
          the other also firing horizontal like towards the center thus 
          covering the convoy , fuck the infra red beacon just hit anything 
          on the rooves , the air was highly blocked up by red tape and 
          efeminate place regarding group think that just wants to maximise
          global torture anyway , they needed a lot freer air cover not so 
          blocked up , and red taped , what if they got up off the ground 
          and took one of the roof tops? they could get trapped up there , 
          just go up to clear it and then back down and cover the stairs , 
          or remove the f mgroup think from the air cover , could they use 
          some kind of light armor on arms and legs that would lessen wounds 
          but not stop them that could also breath like a mesh? Kevlar? or 
          strips of Kevlar that would take out half the bullets but not 
          killing in heat , what about the old Japanese samari armor but 
          with Kevlar , but Japan is cold , what about radio controlled 
          bear sized tanks?  with flat bed trailers the soldiers could ride 
          on and when they take fire they jump off and take cover and use 
          the tank to blast the roof tops which could also detach from the 
          flat beds via radio signal , what about small hand held drones 
          to fly up and give them a birds eye view , or maybe the mini 
          tank could have a small armed air plane that straifs the roof 
          tops , lay down your arms be not mixed be pure stop relying on 
          s the sword the sword you wield will kill you in the end , go 
          into whatever slavery and be free , but probably just keeping 
          the birds moving spinning jiving would have solved the whole 
          thing but people don't want to look too hard for what nothing 
          could be done , why do it , also they should have had mass 
          continuous grenade launchers in the humvees in addition to 
          those near useless 50s , that way they could lob the roof tops 
          if the launchers could be trimmed right , keeping them black 
          hawks circling at high rates of turn and firing down from the 
          steep banking would have solved the whole thing , that's what 
          I would have done , if I had been the general and if I had 
          known , and it hadn't been a Thursday , if you could do just 
          one thing that would be it , but don't bother me , and , it's

          An arranged marriage.  How is it done.  She has no mother and 
          father?  He made those too?  He didn't bother.  He made those 
          later.  No they just tell him she comes from one of the other 
          whatchamacallits around.  Her parents both died in a fermentation 
          accident.  But why him.  Well she needs a husband and all the 
          others just happen to be taken this month so why not.  - You need
          to be settled down.  And looks to she's looks to she might be just
          the girl to do it. -  In answer to you query <a pause> <reading>
          <waiting> -- mm I didn't say anything -- - in answer to your query 
          you're too polite to ask - and I really shouldn't answer you 
          but I will - <sly glint> - yes - you're thinking - God help you 
          - what is her great fault - that we are saddling her with you 
          - on such short notice - you will rue that thought - her greatest
          fault - it's strange but true - is that she's too perfect.  And
          because of this no one will touch her with a tent pole and she 
          sits alone every night sewing things for people.  Who just can't 
          stand to be around her.  They don't want to it's not her fault 
          but she just drives everyone crazy.  And though they try to stay.
          Though they try to talk to her.  To be with her.  They just have
          to turn away before too long.  And flee.  Making apologies that
          drift back up to her as they quickly take their leave feigning
          bladder problems.

          the thought of her being shunned in such a way draws up a involuntary like in him
          he knows the feeling well he feels his mouth his jaw solidifying
          he hears his sound slowing down to the point of pain
          he feels his brain turning to mud and then wild rays bursting out of the soup
          that he watches never knowing what calamity they will soon return
          on peoples faces
          bracing


  
          the elder is reading
          he sees it
          and he knows 
          where it comes from
          but he can't really feel it
          he doesn't know
          but he puts his hand up on Kiev's shoulder
          ( and whispers )<---[ a breach ]
          another sly glint
          and Kiev doesn't know if he likes all these sly glints he is getting
          his stomach starts to turn
          like finding out your father was a chicken farmer who took to raising men and then slaughtering them
          just like chickens in huge well designed and constructed structural cement pires
          the elder read this too
          .
          - and I've got a little surprise - for you - Kiev - I think you'll like it -
          -- <oh no not another> -- 
          - don't worry - it's not a trick - <thinking better of it> - <a pause> - <reconnecting> - 
          <squeezing his shoulder> 
          - you will like it - <another sly glint>
          -- <Kiev could see he was trying not to glint now but it wasn't working> --
          -- <Kiev could see that he had just realised that any further talk would just dig him in deeper> --
          -- <so he said> --
          - you're going to like it - a lot - <a distant look slightly past him> 
          - <akin to guilt but with mitigations muddying the water> -
          - a lot - <he gives Kiev's shoulder a little push> <it's time to go>
          -- Thank you sir -- - see you Sunday Kiev - -- Yes --
          -- <Kiev walks out the door wondering what just happened> --
          - <another sly glint but far away also wondering> -


          The first he sees her she's in white.  It's too austentatious.  
          But the dress is part of her.  It grew out of her.  The plain 
          one she was wearing swelled up and burst when she stood on the 
          aisle and took the elder's arm and out swung all of this.  A gasp. 
          A torrent of gasps no one heard.  As they all crane.  and then a 
          mass memory cutting it short.  One of the elders shoots black at 
          the other one on her arm with fire in his eyes bulging blood red 
          vessels shot threw with momentary malice red white and blue hot.  
          The other one shoots back bloody murder until he remembers looks 
          at her and here and there at her and then back to him and shrugs.  
          Who knows.  God damned software.  
          .
          her waiste tight white iron belt

          tiny ribs rays lines shooting up hip

          cyrus lace between tight hip that loose cloud whisps on their way up
          sucking all the clear of this impossible green and bright blue day 
          compacting into the foundations arrising now to support
          flare
          down
          sweeping out
          not too wide not too narrow a fiery furnace youth she
          perfect
          perfects sloping out and down in back her wide turning narrows 
          as she passes but upheld hitting the peeks of clovage
          higher than he could know    from his vantage
          two round planets press
          sub white echo existence
          in her wake

          foundation stones
          waisting 

          veiled yes

          downed in white

          press          then the blast wave hits       knocking all hats akilter     or was that just the wind
          white whithering V sheilding all the world from her naked 
          fusing core but it's a lie it's not protecting him at all but devastating more
          elyptic curves sheets her fiery red yellow youth her topmost beguiling plush of space filling surface her 
          she's too analog to e er understand to ever know she goes down forever with no bottom in sight
          coiling into her divide crushing into her between bouncing back another round to equal swell
          uncountable any all can always can has can one more unknown complex fill
          a vortex her he cant escape nev r
          once he i n alls in to her own too     much
          and she still as want drops in the key with a unknowing look
          disappearing vanishing between her
          finger pressed down
          out
          of 
          sight
          where 
          he must
          search for it

          he touches it
          with her finger
          so little
          pushing out in filling
          chaos lit mad driving all a round
          so high stretch
          she glares at him
          bemused disappointed 
          at the point of impact
          with no pact
          untouched
          he's beginning to shake
          she sees it and it hurts

          she removes her finger

          tears well up from a lake
          she's held so long forever new store
          she starts to pull away
          this shocks him
          bad         wakes him up
          he feels the pick and he knows he has to act
          he raises his hand quick and holds it up flat
          and she stops

          She looks up reading
          tightly locked
          he goes blind again
          there seems to be some kind of a dim white halo radiating out from her eyes
          so large
          so many levels
          so deep

          there he is again      he reads

          his mind has just gone blank

          she sees it and her eyes get pulled up stantaineous sucked up in the middle like at Dresden 
          instant and gone
          but his attempt to stop her gives her a shot of spite a call to arms against her long plight
          her eyes flash hot
          her lips stiffen spout
          and she grabs his finger lifts it and presses it home into her balanced and lets go
          her eyes widen a little called back to life he watches them dance away from him and 
          saying to herself he reads this is nothing like my touch this is new surprising me 
          what are you doing to me Kiev she looks
          but waves stop her waves rushing over her from out of the single point of contact at the tip
          why is this different than when I brush against a cabinet door on my way 
          but it is
          oh God it is
          her eyes roll up a little gliding smooth instant gone
          and drift back down
          and fight to refocus
          their spell broken he dispanics back and reads
          is he taking something from me    he shouldn't    oh wait
          she looks down
          and sees her own magnificence
          oft hated cataclysmic rolling summer hills
          and knows what she is going to do to him
          and reels

          he can't move

          ( I can't really listen to anyone else's opinion of what I write.  I 
          want to listen and I may change things like if I had an editor to target 
          me to an audience.  but I can't really listen.  just like I can't really 
          listen to any suggestions of not being a christian.  the core is till 
          death do us part.  so when I write certain things I really like it like 
          getting high.  it sings to me.  I probably am high.  it's called 
          hypergraphia.  so I think it's like the best thing I have ever heard.  
          And then I turn away from it and that high feeling quickly fades and 
          when I remember it as this is happening it doesn't seem so good anymore.  
          And as I keep coming down it seems worse and worse.  Until it seems bad.  
          And that's why I never look at it again.  Because I'm afraid that I will 
          not see it again like I saw it when I was high off of it.  I am afraid 
          that it will not generate that high if I just read it.  So I am a sucker 
          for hints that I might get that I can confuse into something linking to 
          me.  Hints that get me thinking people think it's good.  Really good.  
          immediately I glom onto that idea because then I can just take their 
          word for it and live in this fantasy where I don't have to read it again 
          and find out for myself.  I imagine I will be sorry if I don't like it
          anymore.  But who cares.  Who cares.  I should see for myself if I 
          still like it or not.  If I don't.  Then I should probably know that.  
          And stop hiding from it.  So I have this suspicion that I actually 
          hate everything that I write.  And if I do then I should find it out.  
          I need to stop taking hints that may have nothing to do with reality 
          and are just serving to trip me up.  Letting me believe that I would 
          like what I write but absolving me of actually finding out.  So I 
          wind up living in this counter productive fantasy. ) )
