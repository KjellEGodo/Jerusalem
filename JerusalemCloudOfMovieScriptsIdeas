( ACharacterSpec-named:copyrightBy:spec: ( kiev )( copyright kjell e godø )( kiev is an high functioning autistic spectrum black smith christian amish young man 18 to 22 quite buff like a body builder.  he gets interested in astronomy.  and he is looking at the stars one night through a home made telescope that he somehow cobbled together from some vague sketches in a library book.  he has been working on it for a long long time and it just barely works.  he gets very blocked by failure but somehow keeps going after a while but it's frightfully slow work.  a vague dream that keeps coming.  and one night when he is looking up at the warped barely magnified bright specs in the sky one of the stars disappears for about 5 minutes and then comes back again.  He tries to tell people but nobody remotely believes him except for scott.  This baffles him for a while.  And then he starts trying to grind glass even more to the point that it makes his black smithing suffer.  And he keeps trying to tell people.  To the point that the synthetic elders searches for and finds an open source synthetic human compilation program in one of the databases in his head in one of the forgotten corners.  and he adjusts the default settings a bit in the course of an afternoon and creates aurora in order to distract kiev and stop him grinding glass all the time.  he makes her hard to get.  maybe that will key the young women in the audience.  So there is a boy sees girl boy can't do anything about it boy loses all hope boy gets girl boy loses girl boy goes on quest to get girl back boy gets girl back the end opportunity.  except that it isn't the end.  and they don't blow up into acrimony as so often is the case in these things.  no they get funny instead.  and they hit rough patches but the wisdom baked into her open source programming helps them get out of it.  and his dna helps some too.  so aurora is set up to distract kiev which works too well.  the elder gives her some basic subconscious proclivities that she can't see.  but they drive her personality and choices to a large degree.  eventually she finds out that she is synthetic when another synthetic tells her and then she can see all the programming constraints that were put into her.  because he tells her how to unlock them in order to prove it to her.  she goes running away she won't believe it and he yells something after her telling her how to unlock it.  she won't listen and she runs away from it as fast as she can and squeezes it out of her mind.  but at some point she needs it or wants it or it just keeps coming up in her mind and one morning when they wake up she just accesses it and unlocks it or there is a big blow up that needs it in the knick of time ?  no i don't want to do that.  she just does it one morning.  maybe there is a nagging problem off in the distance that is coming and they can't stop it and there is no way out.  and so.  she keeps thinking about it.  it keeps coming up in her mind.  she keeps wondering about it.  and finally she accesses it and unlocks it and somehow that gets them out of their jam.  she was the leader of them before but now she is the leader of herself.  the ceo.  she can break her old personality and choose a new one on the spot and choose how long it will take to take effect.  perhaps the rules can be displayed onto her vision point of view like in terminator to some extent.  does she hold onto the old personality constraints?  as what she has always known?  or does she delete all and write something new.  a new personality.  perhaps she is afraid of something.  and that thing is shutting her down.  and that fear was placed there by the elder the madmen.  and she erases it.  and replaces it.  and then she is able to stand up without the fear and a bunch of amazing things happen.  she walks right through a bunch of stuff without looking at the bullets flying all around her like patton might do on the battle field.  like in the lone wolf with cub books. ) ) )
( ACharacterSpec-named:copyrightBy:spec: ( aurora )( copyright kjell e godø )( initially patterned after aurora ( needs a different name ). An artificial human.  Constructed by a secretly singular subset of the waymish eldership for the purpose of taming kiev who is threatening to discover and publish abroad a theory of the universe as an artificial construct? She has an extreme curves body with a twin black holes bust that not even light is fast enough to escape. We are talking world class.  Hopefully such an actress can be found who is not only world class stacked but is also unknown star power actress with a lot of depth? Can such a thing exist? Or does the rack destroy it by negating the need to develop any depth?  She also has a somewhat narrow waist and large hips and a muscular dancer thighs and a r crumb clovage.  She is brilliant smart and is a miser.  A perfected aurora I guess. She is drop dead irresistible sexual and keeps touching herself and inciting mass sexual desire.  ? There is athletic sex going on 3 or more times a day which are accompanied by noises he makes when his brains fall out constantly and she screams out her wedded orgasms and makes a lot of noise.  I want to counter the type that marriage stops sex.  He can't keep his hands off her which she loves.  ?  Her purpose is to keep him distracted so he won't publish anything about the sky.  Publish means tell.  She is super strong but doesn't  know it.  She keeps getting in trouble trying to keep something from falling down and kiev keeps saving her which incites her to incite him to extreme sexual hero madness brains falling out.  .?.  Well they're young. But once it goes badly and kiev is going to get maimed by some wooden mechanical scissors action and  she saves him using her auxiliary super human strength which freaks her out because she doesn't know she can but now she knows how to Access it.  She screams and cries and has a break down.  A bug has unlocked the interface which she can now see.  Maybe we see a blinking Linux prompt in her first person point of view.  She doesn't just accept it immediately.  It drives her crazy.  She begins to know that some of her strongest held feelings and beliefs are not really her own.  She can read the personality code files.  Perhaps she was constructed too quickly using shoddy abandonware open source AI that just happened to be in one of the hidden singular elder's heads downloaded on some forgotten previous.  Perhaps a link to modern kid advertising could be made.  Functional MRI programming.  So is this drama or comedy.  Too many concepts?  Perhaps we can keep the concepts hidden?  She's artificial created on a whim easy peasy and she gets pregnant and produces a synthetic child. A jesus child. no. maybe. partly.  At first all this stuff is unexplained and unknown.  It gets explained in a sequel movie.  Doing flash backs?  Hopefully this stuff can be hammered out so that it isn't so concepty. ( comment:-- ( yyyymmddOnDate:atGMTime: 20140309 1:58 ) The pbs tpt production of H.M.S. Pinafore from Minnesota shows how smart women on stage can still be busty.  I wonder how they got so many in one show.  It seemed to be like a theme.  Which makes me wonder.  Whether or not i should.  Busty and even distractedly so.  They even use the cleavage as a prop at one point.  I want aurora to be a frustrated busty actress with a huge chip on her shoulders who has worked really hard and gotten nowhere.  Find her.  From 18 to the early 20s.  Busty and really pretty.  I want her to be busty to the point of distraction.  And then i want to make her the smartest person in the room.  The leader most of the time.  Funny and smart and strong.  Her purpose is to distract kiev away from his curiosities and she full fills it well.  He has a fetish and she is it 1000%.  So they are constantly doing it.  Like the monster and the rich girl in Young Frankenstein.  he goes berserk and makes a lot of noise which he can't help even a little because the fetish is driving him nuts.  And she makes even more than he.  On the special website the R rated scenes are included and the other special website has all the X rated scenes included.  She will attract guys to the films all by herself.  but the girls like romance and there's none there yet.  kiev is supposed to be a tall blonde buff healthy iron worker what do you call them.  A black smith.  Maybe that will bring in the young ladies.  Aurora is smarter than kiev with hidden talents that keep popping up.  She is synthetic after all.  She can get pregnant and produce a synthetic classic hybrid or fully classic or fully synthetic baby.  perfect or random.  she can decide what to make it but she doesn't know that.  She has virus technology that increases production and friction of his junk by making it bigger.  Like 13.5 inches.  is the limit i'm told.  So she is very good at distracting kiev which is what she was designed to do.  And it is working until he hears the sound of the pony scooter off in the distance.  And kiev winds up giving her an ultimatim that she either come with him or stay behind.  She was set up to keep him stayed put so at first she won't leave and keeps trying to make him stay.  But he won't stay and eventually she winds up bolting with them by overriding her cheap hacked programming and she winds up taking over the group and leading it.  Which means that they are still doing it all the time on the road in various places and positions.  i want to combine christianity and extreme wild sex and marriage all in the same package.  and totally violate every secular porno dogma and christian tradition with the last ounce of will. ) ) )

glory.  sg lg is perfect for this.  without eye makeup she looks jewish.  and she can do a jewish accent which will be really funny at some point for a surprise.  without eye makeup she looks exactly like glory J.  or whatever you want to call it.  if only she could learn to bend it like meryl.  or maybe she can just be herself.  i want her to do something that she knows.  well.  and that is being a god and wanting to come down and throw off all the pixie dust and just be core.  i wish she would go  to the school that meryl went to and go through the same training.  i don't want glory to be some 2 dimensional place holder stuck there by people who can't take it any farther.  some good witch of the north.  i liked the good witch of the north but i want to make glory so much more.  i want to make her the center.  she has an infinite number of personalities inside of her and one of them is glory.  and maybe gl could play some of the other Jerusalem personalities is she could learn how.  i want her to be the best.  i want her to get an ffing o for playing god.  yes.  i want everything that is inside of her in real life to get distilled down into glory.  i want her to make the central connection with one of her fans.  and do it.  right down to the nth degree.  if at all possible.  at the her level.  if 100 people can make it happen then i want it to be done.  maybe one of her real life fans could play the other character(s).  maybe one of her real life fans could have movie sex with her.  huh?  huh?  what kind of a demographic does that pencil out to?  have an american idol style contest to see who will play it?  an internet only contest?  or something.  i don't know.  let me think about it.  glory wants to throw off the pixie dust but the pixie dust is still there.  glory is still glory.  but she has to find a way to come down.  she has to find a way to poke through the pixie dust and extend a hand.  she knows how because she is the know and tech of YHWH but she acts like she has to work it out.  and she does.    glory runs the Jerusalem glory is the Jerusalem.  and she makes a connection with one( many ) of the characters in the Jerusalem and she keeps it.  she keeps it going.  she is there.  at first the ship had a limit beyond which it could not go a maximum resolution.  but jaycob makes it go infinite.  and gl will be perfect for that.  no doubt she will play hard to get.  no doubt everybody will play hard to get.  or else i am insane and none of this is real and nothing will ever happen.  some poor sad bus stop to know where      the Jerusalem script cloud will have to proceed at a pace so that it gets to her before she gets too old.?   maybe she will age well.?  maybe all the films can be made all at once and come out all at once and people can go from one to the next to the next to the next all at once.?  the cashiers will have to tell everyone that there is an order.  to it.  maybe they can be made so that it doesn't really matter what order you see them in.  what if J was in all the theaters at once.?   not going to happen.   the first one was to be a low budget no science fiction thing.  maybe kickstarter.  and it would keep building from there.  but what if she gets too old?  if they can all be made at once with different directors then that would be good.  i know that i don't have the training to direct.  but i want to direct the director.  i want a cloud of us to direct the directors.  lion's gate/   like chillhooli  i need to stop blowing glass so i can blow way more glass than i could ever blow.  if i can ever get up off the couch.  ok      it's doomed.     might as well quit now                                            man this is too much space opera               I want to violate the formula                 so much              but how            these thing must be done        delllllllllicately     or you harm the spell                 reddwarf              no          yes        no        violated it from the first minute to the last               but reddwarf          is too hard            isn't it           violate the third wall         no       maybe      some            at first it was just talk and that's what i want it to be first        just talk        and then as they got more and more money they mixed in more and more action but the talk was always there           i want that         so much        i want to violate that formula           so much         but the last action hero is like a really big mine under the water           ticking          waiting          what was wrong with it         i liked it          but the people who would have liked it didn't come and the people who came just felt violated      not in a good       way       OOP        what if people just went into a standup routine every now and again        with no audience       that is a real violation        maybe in the higher levels they might do that         i want to violate the formula by looking ahead into the future and wondering what social customs might be there whether or not it violates what people expect         think about the things that kids do now that would have violated how people thought you could act in the past          if you went back in time and put those things in a movie             would they just reject it face down and complete           and burn down the theater           no matter how accurately you made it real          i want to burn down the theater             maybe they all speak shakespearean on the higher levels           or some complex thing poetry that you can just barely get            in real time          yeah           in places i want to be as funny as the daily show or politically incorrect           yeah i want to hire that guy        dam i can[t think of it       he is the funniest guy on the planet          a woody level          but he's a damm atheist         so i cant use him       ow well               well              at least he's not a dammm athtanist               i love those             i want to violate the formula like a taichi master violates your balance when you try to grab him         and put him in a box          i need help              that miss who 30 rocks           or some cheap down and comer with a chip on s he r(s) shoulder        haven't got a chip           WELL GET ONE                i want one place        one place where it all comes together and it's soo funny that people well         you can't buy that          and i have no idea how to get it     can it be max horror and max funny at the same time          no not like that          cheep        i don't like horror         horror is too easy           i don't want bullying            that's too cheap          so i want to have the guy who wins the contest           as decided by truth futures         to get gl's phone number and become a permanent part of her family         he can call her up any time of the day or night          and if she changes her number she has to give it to him just like he was a brother         if she rejects him then it will have to be like rejecting a sibling           and he will be like the j esus to her y hwh  to her fans        his life is public from that moment on       everything he sees everything he hears everything he does from that moment on is public        and the fans can tell him what to do by truth futures           they get to tell him what to do        some number of times a day according to some truth futures market          what to say       each final word gets a number and each number can have one or more words in it and each word has a truth futures market on it        and the phrases and sentences also      fans are making and trading truth futures markets as fast as lightning       in real time      truth futures coming up with each new word added        deciding what he will say to her in real time        and going over everything that he does          having access to everything he does          who knows         maybe she will throw off her random          and marry her fn/as        through him              yeah        he should be        so that that could happen       don't look at me man              i'm out              it's yours now          over and out         no wait     there's more         when the truth futures get up to a certain price on a word or phrase or sentence then that becomes a final word and he says it            via         a speaker in his hear  embedded into his bone       and a microphone in his larnix               and                     that can be switched out        highest quality           and sensors in his body monitoring      heart             rate and blood pressure and stress hormones etc    and his brain waves and his thoughts we          ll         he has to blog and life tweet everything he is thinking     and anybody who tries to cut him for it w       i     ll be violated by service people coming and    no going     and they say         pop          as they are going o      ut the door     by law nobody can cut him in any way because of something they know that they wouldn't  know about a regular person    nobody can cut him for things that would normally remain private   they can put it into a truth futures market and the truth futures market can talk to him about it          and then we take all this and put it into the Jerusalem as something that is common in the future     on certain tech levels that allow it      deq                                 so he has to be good looking     slightly autistic        an actor       good      or could be good        who is willing to sign         who can somehow prove that he can take it and won't bomb out        with actors waiting in the wings to take his place if he tears up the contract      but he can never really tear up the contract       we want an actor who is a fan who is a born journalist exhibitionist ( autistic )( gay )( a real bitch )( no )( the ken doll )( no ) who wants to be an actor from the minute he wakes up on that day to the minute he dies       on stage hopefully some time later       the role of a lifetime      enough                 wait         so       how does he have privacy        how does he exercise his own will         he doesn't have to do what the truth futures tell      he has final say     he can turn it off      if he wants      he can go away      he can try      and then he can come back again      but the sensors stay on       no       he has to tear up the contract to turn them off     if he has them extracted then the contract is torn up in a public execution paper shredder and the shreds lit up and burned by vodka spritzer ok the contract is litterally written in stone and when it gets violated and terminated then there is a public demolition by nuklear vapor Izze  ation and he is replaced by the next one in line     after a period of arabian morning     which ends on a set date      he can go away     and the contract will stay good     he can listen to the voices of the night  and decide what to do      okay so the sensors work by beaming radio waves at some unit inside of him that then reflects the data back     or somehow it uses the atp in the body to power itself           .  stop gl his cira no         i want a real AO authentic arabian morning that is created by an arabian cloud of truth           . ) ) )

If you turn around and give up and walk back out of the forest you won't recognize the tree formations and land scape of the forest where you went in.  It is as if you went in one way and came out another.  The synthetic humans in the waymish lands don't know they are synthetic.  Their brains are connected up to a radio network like wifi.  And they have an audience inside their heads.  The audience consists of people or entities who live in other places where the technology is on a higher level than the waymish land.  Above the level of the synthetic humans.  The audience experiences everything the not an actor thinks and feels but still retains a separation from it if desired.  Sometimes the audience can insert thoughts into the mind of the not an actor.  Also when these synthetic humans get near to the forest surrounding them then they get a vague sense of dread that repels them more and more the longer they are in it.  As they move away from the forest this feeling subsides.  There is a road that goes through the forest.  The forest is not very wide where the road crosses it.  You can stand at the edge of the forest on the road and look into the dark and see light on the other side in the day time like looking down a tunnel perhaps 4 or 5 foot ball fields long. If you try to walk down this road into the forest you can walk 150 yards into the forest and then you don't seem to make any further progress after that.  And if you look back you see that you are only 150 feet from the entrance where you entered the forest.  Also thoughts about the forest barrier can be removed from the minds of the synthetic humans.  And memories also.  This can be used to keep the antique humans away from the forest barrier.  They just can't keep thoughts about the forest barrier in their heads for more than a few minutes.  So rad and kiev ( i need different names i keep thinking Kiev instead of kiev ) try to cross the barrier on the scooter.   ) )
( AStoryIdea-named:copyrightBy:idea: ( the scooter )( copyright kjell e godø )( rad's bike.  It looks like a girlie motor scooter but sinisterly bigger.  The back end where the motor is is bigger and sticks out to the sides like a small horse's rear using dynamic torsion and automotive ovals and trim lines to give the feeling of unguessed power. There are symbols like decals printed onto this back end of the scooter and the scooter can change these at will like a visual language.  The scooter is bigger than a scooter and the running board is a little longer so that the front of the scooter sticks out farther than a regular scooter.  The wind shield is bigger and goes up high the top edge of the wind screen goes up high like higher than usual.  The front and back wheels and tires are wider than a regular scooter maybe not quite like a really wide chopper tire because we want it to have a demure feminine aspect but it can suddenly get a lot wider like a wide chopper tire when traction is needed.  The tires can get narrower when it is low on gas.  Or maybe it doesn't run on gas.  Maybe it runs on water like in back to the future.  The speedometer is round with radiating tick marks like on a clock.  But the tick marks get closer and closer together as you get closer and closer to top speed until they are so close together that they become a single blob of lines.  The lowest tick marks have numbers on their ends just like standard speedometers like 10 , 20 , 30 , ... but these numbers fade out and get fainter and fainter as the numbers go up.  There are two portals like exhaust ports in the back.  But these are shaped strangely. They have a kind of oval aspect to them with exhaust shapers like on a fighter jet.  The oval shape lets the designer put ovals in ovals near the ends of the ports to make them look more interesting.  There are two smaller exhaust ports in the front of the scooter as well.  Or maybe there is a single circular exhaust port around the head light in front.  Yes that's better.  That way it doesn't look like an exhaust port at first.  So the scooter can change shape at will also.  So at first the rear exhaust ports look small like tail pipes.  But they can get bigger if needed.  So the scooter looks girlie at first.  But it has these hints that maybe that's not all that it is. So one idea is that the scooter is from a higher more advanced technology place.  Like somehow a subset of rad's audience put this scooter in his hands.  And he doesn't think much of it when he first gets it.  Because it just looks small and feminine and unassuming.  And he just uses it for getting around town in 1950's tech land where he and lynn live.  I don't know if rad knows he is in an amish style artificially designated tech specified zone or land or area where only 1950's technology can exist.  Maybe he is a synthetic human and doesn't know it.  kiev is an antique human and doesn't know about the synthetic humans all around him.  Scott might be antique also.  Or maybe kiev is the only antique human.  Perhaps he was made antique with no modifications according to an original DNA stored in memory from antiquity 100 years earlier before the singularity.  No.  It has to be longer.  500 years or more.  Technology is static in each designated tech level area so these areas can go on forever without any progress.  Or perhaps progress is made up to a certain point and then everybody's memories are reset back in time and the technology is reset as well.  There are places out in the three dimensional super structure inside of the earth where technology is advancing at exponential pace.  And many of these synthetic humans get tired of the rapid change all the time and go to one of the restricted tech areas to live a simpler life.  Embedded in all the technology is the law that higher tech shall not affect lower tech or attempt to drive lower tech out of existence or delete the restricted tech areas.  Just like there is the endangered species act there is the endangered tech act.  And the equal opportunity for humans act.  Which all new tech must follow.  rad has a car as well as the scooter.  Just like the real rad.  And it gets all dusty and wrecked but it can repair itself and clean itself and wash and wax itself and turn shiny and spangly again.  The scooter is puke pink sometimes when it wants to be really feminine and other times when it wants to get really cool it can go red with a thick layer of lacquer so that the blue of the sky mixes with the red and makes it look really cool.  And somewhat dangerous. So rad and kiev try to drive out of waymish land down the road but they can never get more than 150 or 250 yards into the forest even though they seem to be going pretty fast.  The scooter is looking pretty pink. They have got it floored but 55 is just not enough.  The scooter has a motorcycle throttle on the handle bar and also a pedal on the floor.  You can get it going with either one.  So some more strife ensues I don't know what.  Maybe kiev and rad get chased somehow or i don't know what.  But rad remembers or figures out or they both figure out that if they go fast enough the scooter starts to rise up off the ground.  The scooter doesn't have wings so it just goes straight.  This is because everything is being held down by centrifugal force and not gravity.  So if you go the same speed that the synthetic planetary bubble is going around the true center of the earth then you are standing still and become weightless. And so they get the idea that they can jump over the forest instead of driving through it on the road. Originally rad drove the other direction down the road into the waymish area and that was fine but then when he tried to get back out again then he couldn't.  So the scooter at some point turns into its cool fast self as they are going to try to put this plan into action.  It got fast earlier which was how they figured out they could make it float.  They don't know that the earth they know is just a fake earth in a bubble with a fake plasma sky that is rotating around the center of the hollowed out earth. There are multiple of these planetary bubbles inside of the earth.  The earth is very big and hollowed out by the builder machines that ran amuck some time after the singularity and turned the earth inside out in order to get more living space for a growing population of synthetic humans.  And a few antiques. So they see that the scooter has changed at some point and this sets them to wondering.  When kiev first sees the scooter in it's pink mode he is so shocked by it since he has only ever known wrought iron that he has pounded into shape himself and he has a future shock that reduces him to mush.  He keeps touching the smooth manufactured perfect lines.  With his mouth hanging open in abject awe.  And the scooter starts changing into a racier sexier format as he keeps touching her and this causes even more future shock.  And then rad gets it too but he turns away.  rad keeps turning away until he becomes a double inhabiting two states at once.  not future shocked and future shocked both.  So five of them decide to try to jump the forest.  rad is in the drivers seat.  and lynn is on his lap.  And scott is sitting on the long seat behind rad.  maybe lynn looks like grethe.  and there are new running boards going down the sides of the scooter and kiev is on the left side and aurora is on the right side of the scooter standing on the running board and holding onto each other and onto rad and scott and lynn.  need new names.  So they go way down the road and turn around and sit there planning.  And as they are planning and out of their sight the scooter keeps changing under their feet.  But it should be classy magic that is subdued and more realistic like in 2001 a s o and not super bombastic like in a lot of movies.  Probably only kiev can see the scooter changing and the others don't ever look at it long enough to see.  Or it keeps changing back when ever they look at it.  We see it changing and kiev sees it changing but the others don't.  Or they tend not to.  So they take off and the speedometer keeps going up and as it goes up the numbers on the tick marks get more and more solid and distinct.  And the numbers keep going up and up and up. Until they are going 600 maybe.  And it has to be a real 600 and not 35mph because that's as fast as the camera truck can go.  And then they lift off and float up into the air as the ground is rotating below them. So it looks like they are going to whiz right over the forest barrier but as they get half way over it and seem to be passing over the mid point then they can see their goal is at hand.  Easy peasy.  But then the forest starts to grow out in front of them.  And now they are starting to lose altitude due to air friction and they start to sink.  There should be some more dire evil about the forest so that you really don't sink back down into it.  And so this keeps going and it looks like they are not going to make it but then there is house or a building up ahead and when the forest gets to the house it stops growing and bounces back a little like in Tron.  So now they might make it.  And they are trying to will the scooter forward to make road on the other side of the forest.  But they come short and fall down through the branches of the leaf trees and hit the road like 25 yards from the light and rad guns the scooter and the speedometer rises 400 500 600 700 and the road beneath them is whizzing  by at 700 miles per hour but they are losing ground.  The trees on either side are still but the road is whizzing by at 700 miles per hour and they are slowly but surely losing ground and getting further and further from the light.  So they start yelling something or other i don't know what and kiev is yelling at rad to floor it and he says that he is.  And it looks like they are not going to make it but then kiev sees the pedal on the floor boards and stamps it to the floor and the exhaust ports in the back fire up.  And they slowly start to make progress 800 900 and they get out into the light and are almost to the end of the place where they can see how the new road is being created out in front of them like 20 feet ahead.  And then these two big fans like wind mills rise up out of the ground where they were  just created and instantly start spinning so fast that they can't be seen.  And now the skin on their faces is flapping around at super sonic speeds and now the port in the front of the scooter lights up and produces an air wind shield and then the force on them reduces and they stop getting ripped apart.  And now something happens i don't know what.  They are held in place at the end of the road.  With the two fans blaring.  And kiev starts talking to her or something and the orange flames in the rear ports turns blue and gets a lot hotter and gets a weird hallow ring around each port and then they blast through the fans and take off up into the air again.  And kiev takes his foot off the pedal and rad looses the throttle and the scooter turns several shades pinker as they slowly start to descend.  Back down to the road beneath them but then the road swerves away to the left and then start coming down into a corn field or some damn thing.  And as they get closer to the tops of the corn then the wheels of the scooter extend downwards like more of an off road format.  And then they hit pay dirt and corn hits them all upside and the scooter pitches sideways and they all go flying in every different direction landing in the corn.  So then they have to find each other again and some dialog ensues.  Maybe they can't find the scooter anywhere.  The scooter has blushed away or something.  It tries go go back to being a rickety old dusty scooter.  But the jig is up and more dialog ensues.  As they try to talk to it.  But it won't listen.  It just keeps getting ricketier and ricketier.  Or something. It blushes pinker and pinker and then takes on a layer of grey dust.  And its spokes start breaking like old guitar strings. And then they come upon a freeway and kiev and aurora and scott have more future shock because they come from 1820.  kiev and aurora ( name? ) and scott seem to be screaming all the time or something because they are having acute future shock.  So you need really insightful actors to do the future shock right. They need to put into their faces and voices what we all are or will soon feel deep down.  It has to be subtle. and without a lot of sawing of the air.  But it has to be real.  Future shock and culture shock is at the core. Usually people in movies just take everything in stride.  A couple lines of dialog and completely up to speed and thoroughly and completely modern.  I don't thing that is real.  I don't think that real people can look on the face of YHWH like it was a burnt out fluorescent light bulb unaffected.  I don't think that is real. So one of the movie episodes is a road trip.  And you can do all sorts of things with the scooter.  And the synthetic earth is a half sphere inside of another half sphere.  So as they are pealing out to get away from the cops or whatever that are chasing them they actually start to feel gravity going side ways as they get closer and closer to the edge.  And finally gravity is going parallel to the ground and pulling everything and the cop cars forwards until finally the ground pulls away below and everybody falls off the edge of the world.  Into the carbon super structure inside the earth that keep the different synthetic earths in place.  The center of the real earth is a spherical empty space.  And everything is being pulled outward by centrifugal force.  Maybe the scooter lights up a different super modern physique and flys them all to one of the advanced technology areas.  Where they meet finally some of their awdience.  No they don't meet them yet.  They have to be plagued by them first. Vampires on the Jerusalem? Devils on the Jerusalem?  Like viruses being continually removed.  By the autonomous mind probes that are continually removing all evil thoughts and sending them out into the asteroids that trail behind the Jerusalem in a network of cables.  There can be Star Wars Star Trek Gravity type space episodes using only conventional space out amongst these trailing asteroids that are like a wooden hydro plane being dragged behind a boy on his bike in the 1960's.  Or like a foot fungus.  Or like a no death penalty.  Because no evil thoughts are allowed on the Jerusalem.  Probably this is not the first New Jerusalem.  But the latest one to be sent out.  Maybe it is the Jerusalem 17.  Or maybe the previous ones were not called Jerusalem but this one with the autonomous mind probes is called Jerusalem and was built without human hands.  None of them were.  Perhaps there could be comedy instead of drama with the mind probes if the AI entity running the mind probes was more weary mother mary rehab rather than hard ass father aneal.  Or maybe both. Or all three.  In revelations there is something that sounds like a laser beam coming out of the sky? Maybe the scooter turns into a metal woman at some point a really curvey one with a world class bust line that he finds hard to resist and tries to have sex with or become kiev's wife or mistress. Maybe she can produce synthetic humans or new little scooters with synthetic brains based on a  combination of kiev's genes and her genes.  Yes the scooter is named Aurora and she has graphic metal sex with kiev and produces little blue and pink scooters and she is able to sit with kiev and choose between the different possible traits.  But some traits they leave up to random chance because it's just too 21st century to decide on all the traits of your offspring and be really hard ass about it all with a super controlling super conforming super optimizing super competitive 2 by 4 stick up your butt sphynx.  Aurora has sex with kiev and while they are doing it she modifies his equipment to make it more for him.  And for her.  So aurora ( name? ) gets really pissed and jealous at kiev when she finds out. But kiev is like he just masterbated or autosexed or something like that because Aurora is just a machine. And then they both find out that aurora is a shodilly produced slapped together synthetic human whose sole purpose is to keep kiev from upsetting the other waymish participants with his atheist anarchist spoutings because maybe Aurora gets jealous too?  Maybe there is a metal synth cat fight?  Comic relief?  Or maybe Aurora is not very upsettable and she just made an off hand remark as aurora's upsettion tries to get a rise out of them and Aurora says it to diffuse the situation?  Can we do something like the movie Her?  Where the dialog is oscar worthy even though there are high concepts about?  Perhaps the high concepts could be introduced in a previous high concept movie episode and this lower budget episode is just about the relations between Aurora and aurora and kiev and etc and Aurora and kiev's kids.  And then aurora finds out that her own kid making ability was turned off by her maker.  And to get it turned back on again she has to become a different person.  Which she won't do.  At first.  But then when Aurora has her babies then aurora gets so wound up she asks to be transformed into an antique like kiev and so she can have a babie.  Her brain becomes antique and so she thinks differently somehow than she used to.  Her programming is gone.  What's aurora's name?  it keeps coming back aurora. And aurora keeps wanting kiev to stop having sex with Aurora.  But kiev cant see why not since she has given him enough juice to do them both and she's just a scooter after all.  Which makes Aurora sort of mad but not really because Aurora doesn't have many really strong emotions and is very self assured.  And why wouldn't she be.  Because she's perfect.  Where as aurora is not perfect because antiques can't be perfect.  The moment they are made perfect is the moment they cease to be antiques. These ideas should be separated somewhat into separate ideas. So aurora gets a car.  And now the shoe is on the other foot.  A car named gari.  And now it is kiev's turn to be jealous.  But even though it drives him crazy she is not interested in gari sexually and is just being nice.  It looks like a motor scooter and has a  feminine quality.  It has some stickers on the round back like the my little ponies stickers on the back of the the ponies. The stickers keep changing.  The audience can see them change when the characters are not looking at them.  The characters don't realize that the stickers are changing.  Perhaps the stickers can have their own language which predict what will happen or comment on what happened recently. kiev or whatever his final name is notices the changes and tries to point out the changes but when ever he does or whenever the other characters are looking at the stickers they change back to what the stickers were when the characters first looked at the scooter and when they turn back away then they turn back into what kiev was trying to point out.  kiev keeps trying and trying to point out the changes but the others can never see it and they start getting mad at him and commenting on his sanity.  And as they get a little madder mild they begin to self congratulate that they are not crazy and in so doing begin more and more to ignore the scooter.  And finally kiev gives up speaking about it but just keeps watching while the others are talking oblivious about some thing much more practical and reasonable and on point and on message but the decals show that everything their perfect logic is concluding is completely bass ackwards wrong and will probably get them killed if put into action.  If the decals can be believed.  He tries to tell them but his ability to explain is really piss poor and his crippled logic is no match for their perfect rhetoric and glib fast talking.  So the audience realizes that they are fucked and the option that will save them will not be taken.  And it's very ironic. kiev tries to point at the decals at first but that's just crazy talk.  Then he gives up that tack but can't make that work either.  So he starts just looking at the decals trying to decipher them while everybody else is doing something that is Not absolute awful Lunacy that actually moves them forward toward total and complete destruction.  Sometimes he is looking at the decals and the change back to the initial decals and stay there right when it was getting good and he realizes that the others are looking and that's why the decals are blocked.  Then they stop looking that way and the decals get to something really good.  Then just as the final message is coming they force him to turn away from it and stop being a low down slob of a bum an help and stop being so lazy that they get killed then it will be all his fault.  So he starts checking what it is saying and winds up winning some points that are eluding the others.  Maybe.  Just ideas.  Here. Maybe at one point the decals seem to turn sadd and he gets horrified and can't see what their game is? And then they seem to try to explain and make it up and get forgiveness for why he pushed he off the ledge. But he just can't believe anything they say by then.  Good or bad it's all just noise and he stops looking. But the decals keep upping the amperage to get him to look.  Finally he gets a camera and starts taking video of the decals and making reports on everything the decals are saying but by then it's so involved that he can't explain most of it so he dumbs it way down and avoids the stuff he can't explain.  At great physical mental cost.  because it's totally unnatural.      he finally starts to get some traction but decides he is never going to get through to these blind people and he needs to find others who will have an easier time listening.  The decals try to keep him from talking.  They make double meanings half positive and the other half veiled threats which make him wonder w Why.  Half awe inspiring and the other half rotting pestilence and putrefaction.  w Why.  half chaos half creation      Lets see.   something.   Olympics Opening.  he won't stop    he won't listen.   They grouse something fierce but it doesn't affect them good for you 23:07 king 20140207 yyyymmdd.

( AStoryIdea-named:copyrightBy:idea: ( artificial universe discovery )(  copyright kjell e godø )( kiev is looking through his telescope at some constellations and one of the stars goes out for 37 minutes and then comes back on again.

( AStoryIdea-named:copyrightBy:startedOnDate:atGMTime:idea: ( truth futures )( copyright kjell e godø )( 20140215 yyyymmdd ) ( 5:20 seattle )( Ok so the way to prevent the expected market manipulation in extreme illiquid markets is to not let anyone but the market administrator? see the truth future's price.  Studies have shown that this works.  Various statistics about the truth future's price will be published at certain intervals like perhaps every 17 days. So the 20 day and 50 day and 200 day moving averages and the standard deviation and mean and Sharpe ratio and historical and implied volatility etc could be published once every agreed upon period of time like once a week or once every 17 days.  Or once every 13 days.  This would be done to keep people interested and keep on truth voting. Once a month or once a quarter or once every 57 days the actual price of the truth future and all the transactions of all of the truth voters would be published into the public record along with the identity of each truth voter. Bitcoin will be used for the truth futures money.  Truth voters will have to give up their bitcoin anonymity which i think can be done with Bitcoin. Perhaps each truth voter will have to get a coinbase.com account and send in notarized documentation like MtGox requires and a hand written notarized essay about why they should be allowed to truth vote and whatever else they want to say and images of these essays will be posted.  Also drawings can be included in the essay(s).  A voter can publish as many of these notarized essays as they want. Each truth voter starts out with $1000 or less in their truth voting account which is stored on coinbase.com. Each transaction will be stored and tracked and checked to make sure that the $1000 limit is never breached.  If it is breached then a public notice will be published and the transaction requested to be undone.  If there is an appeal or if the transaction is not undone then the total public record or the truth voter's transactions will be published and a truth futures market started on it about whether or not the transaction should be reversed.  If the truth vote is good enough to reverse it and the voter still won't reverse it then the voter's account is cancelled for some period of time or until the voter can make public hand written notarized repentance.  Each truth voter gets 70 times 7 of these chances to repent or however many Jesus said there should be. Each truth voter's truth futures voting account can have more than $1000 in it but the only way to get it to have more than $1000 in it is by gaining truth voting profits for truth voting well and truly done. Truth futures transactions will no longer be called transactions or trades but they will be called votes or specifically truth votes. Also if the value of a bitcoin increases then a truth voter's account could have more than $1000 in it?  This might favor initial truth voters too much and this rule might need to be changed if the initial truth voters get too much power by this route or there could be a formula that ... ? Perhaps any bitcoin value generated truth voting profits would be taxed away each month or restored if the value of bitcoin dropped.  Perhaps these taxes could be invested in junk bonds or SPY or treasuries or bitcoin or something. Initially truth futures will be used to vote on movie scripts here etc. But eventually they might be used to manage entire productions. Eventually they might be used for general corporate or open corporate CEO free management. Every digital entity in the system can have a truth futures market(s) attached to it.  And each truth futures market can have 1 or more for profit or free online textual graphical communications forums attached to it. So there have to be legal licenses and what not created for all of this. So the story of the truth voters will be part of the Jerusalem movie cloud in the 2013 level technology planetoid inside the earth.  It will be a low budget or youtube or netflix video series probably. Some of these videos can be ads for the truth futures open corp management free management system(s).  These management system will allow all people to become open corp voters and will allow them all to truth vote on a second by second basis about how the open corp should be run and allowing the truth futures to make every corporate and even operating decision in an open corp.  OpCop? There can be automated truth futures voting bots coded in BorgLisp.  BorgLisp will be the official system language/OpSys.  There will be no unsecure languages like C orJava etc allowed.  And special BorgLisp secure open hardware like the iPad with all encrypted executables etc should be made also. There can be all sorts of derivatives on the truth futures like vanilla options or exotic options etc. If the truth futures voting model of open corp management free management becomes popular then arbitrary limit truth voting markets that compete directly with all the trading markets that exist today might be created. Perhaps there might even be a country somewhere that takes up the truth futures management free management model as a secure open form of sovereign government.  Maybe in africa or somewhere. And if this worked then perhaps even bigger countries could vote in the standard truth futures sovereign corruption free governance free sovereign governance open truth constitution.  And limited account size truth futures on that truth constitution could begin to truth vote ( $100 account limit ).  To adapt it to local customs traditions religions and tastes. And then all the politicians can go home.  Every truth voter will be a politician and corporate manager and master of the coming robot AI invasion. Human level or above AI entities won't be allowed to vote.  I suppose as they become better and better at emotion mimicry or even as they get true biological emotions perhaps this last human protection will eventually fall get voted out and then the human era will end.  And antique human will be born and come under the jurisdiction of the truth endangered species act.

Hi.  still proceeding.  i raised my fingers touching relaxed and you took me in yours.  briefly.  hi.  and so still proceeding we let go as i turn from you east rotate south again and back out of existence.  i woke.  oh bLoody hell.  is this what i really think?  trying to wipe the snow off the bed.  and listed the ways that it could all be just a load of white.  white or no.  what do i care.  it's nothing to do with me.  i just want to see.  to scout out.  and then i'm out.  and then forget the whole thing.  as best i can.  staring right at it YellinG and thinking of Someone else.  and resistless. back out of existence. ) )
( AStoryIdea-named:copyrightBy:startedOnDate:atGMTime:idea: ( hot monogamous siting )( copyright kjell e godø )( 20140301 yyyymmdd ) 15:48 ( I give up on the idea of making the first Jerusalem movies rated r or even x because of wild married sex between kiev and aurora.  So i want to make a special credit card gated website where all those monogamous sex scenes are most gratuitously included. and included and included and included.  The film goes to 6 hours or more long.  With a button that skips to the next good part.  i want to completely break apart this idea that people have that married sex doesn't exist.  it doesn't.  but i want to break down that notion and replace it with something else.  aurora is special compiled to be irresistible to kiev via a telescopic virus transmitted brain scan that mapped out all the sexual attraction sites and 3D contour receptors in his brain ( maybe guys are better at 3D space perception partly for this very reason. certain shapes and silhouettes are DNA burned into our brains and it doesn't seem to matter if the image is actually connected to something real.  The image and the ability to project it into a dream is all that matters.  whereas women's minds seem to recognize stories instead.  plots.  romances.  And there is more emphasis therein on the stories actually being connected to a physical reality.  not.  girls are suckers for words on a page.  whereas guys are suckers for an eye balled image that keys into the 3D projection machines in our brains ).  So when kiev sees aurora he has to touch her and the barrier to entry is low to her and when he touches her then he goes berserk which causes her to go berserk a little later on.  i can imagine it.  so i want to create it.  whether or not i should.  So there could be one version that just gets down to it as quickly as possible and hits all the pay dirt spots and keeps on hitting it and then there can be another version of Jerusalem that is slower and more lit and artistic about it and you can set sliders on the playback as to how much of each you want ( down to it or artistic.  youtube razor thin blades. or playboy lit and with a lot of mindless social defense lizard brain stem spark resistance and incessant weeping up to the long abandoned hope free snap re hoped climax ). ) )

Does she get the same hormones as the other girls?  Or does she keep her aged perspective like wisdom? Or does she see the world in a new way as a young girl again?  But not with the abandon of youth this time?  She can set her age to whatever she wants at any time of day or night and she will slowly grow to that age day by day and month by month at the desired rate within the limits of the tech.  She can set the level of the hormones.  Natural or more detached and subdued as befits age and wisdom and seeing.  If she turns on the juice then she forgets wisdom and starts looking for a mate to lay down a line of kids with.  She can see all the different processes going on inside her.  And explore them and adjust them.  What kind of person does she want to be.  She can adjust for that within the limits of the tech.  Perhaps she comes from a place where they don't have such technology and finds her way to a place where they do.  And she can't resist taking on that power into her body so she can be young again and control every aspect of herself to a degree.  And maybe later on she lets it go and lets her body run down to death as they do where she comes from.  maybe she goes back there and gets shunned until she lays aside the offending technology and sticks to the technology of her birth.

From a single gold and ice 9 seed that is mandelbrot infinite complex.  The culmination of the singularity.  The godlike being holds it in his hand.  And then lets it go like on 12 monkeys and it floats.  And then it drops?  And then it sparks into life as dust in the air spirals into it.  it falls down?  and hits a big ice cube?  which spirals into it and ignights into a rising black hole spiraling and cutting a hole through the earth and up into space.  and then the black hole shrinks back down and gets brighter and then explodes outwards mandelbrot like space filling spirals of transparent gold and silver ice with rainbows refracting in every direction.  the cube is a spiral borg cube of transparent gold and silver ice like glass.  but the borg?  no borg.  The cube grows engines which it lights up down the shaft going down and taxis up into free fall.  out into space.  ok the earth is hollow.  remember.  So the hole doesn't go anywhere.  it just punches through empty space.  maybe it vaporizes the place where kiev comes from.  ?  maybe not.  Maybe a few cells were recovered just prior to ignition.  by nano bots.  so they get on a small ship and go winging into the Jerusalem into all the spiral arms forming the cube.  And they fall into one of the ink blots into the fringe around one of the ink blots.  Cross shaped ink blots ?  heart shape ink blots? the ink blot has to repeat like the mandelbrot ink blot.  the ink blots have to be mathematically smooth yet indistinct if possible.  As they get closer to one of these ink blots kross shaped heart shaped what the blot expands and they shrink and the spirals spiral outward and inward.  An infinite complex.  Maybe they get lost in there.  And start trying to get back out again.  Maybe the Jerusalem creates synthetic humans out of the rocks and the stones which burst into song.  DNA accurate descendants of David.  the godlike being rises up to the bridge.  bridge?  no everywhere is the bridge.  okay so peoples brains get scanned and the Jerusalem won't let anyone still harboring the love of money.  But those people still hanging on can hang on to a christmas tree like structure of spidery web like stiff and bendy spirals like a spiders web out into space trailing behind the Jerusalem that catches rocks and meteors and asteroids like planets where the Star Wars bars and brothels and space ports and drinking dens get constructed by the people still hanging on to it trailing behind the Jerusalem maybe one of the people hanging on to it hollers : What about me?  And then the Jerusalem spins the web out behind it.  And ships can fly from asteroid to asteroid and from space port to space port using nothing but conventional ion drives.  maybe the Jerusalem flies into mars or europa or one of the moons and slices it and the pieces come out the other side and get caught in the web.  And then the Jerusalem takes off for the next star using a huge solar sail and millions of fusion drives and when it gets there it finds a planet and opens up an complex empty cylinder which goes through the Jerusalem and a new black hole collapses and sparks two fountains into the cylinder and collapses down into a gold and silver ice seed.  no.  the seed should be a silver mirror ball like a black hole that reflects the gold behind it momentarily to spark a gold mirror like a black hole so the seed is a black hole a tiny one with some kind of energy field around it keeping it from sucking everything around it.  Or not.  Maybe it just doesn't suck for some reason.  And then the godlike being lets the seed drop onto the planet and a million different new Jerusalems spawn and ignite their engines and make for all the stars in the sky.  Filled with all kinds of synthetic animals and people and beings.  And the lion will eat dust.  and lay down with the lamb.  synthetic creatures maybe some of them look like machines like in biomega.  maybe the Jerusalems make their way to sagitarious and the massive black hole and use the jets to make for another galaxy?  Maybe not.  okay where is the science grounding?  seems we are getting way into fantasy here.  What the hell.  frozen.  maybe a star could be coaxed into spinning in a certain direction.  a new star could be constructed out of gas and pointed in the right direction and then when it collapses into a hypernova the fountain could be used to propel a new Jerusalem out into intergalactic space no a hypernova is too brief.  more fantasy.  well they could avoid the initial fountain and then feed matter into the black hole and use the fountain to sail to the next galaxy.  so the Jerusalem is an infinite complex spiral arm fractal with ink blots like krosses or kearts or both or neither maybe the ink blot changes shape and transparency as you move around it.  like on of those plastic 3D effects.  eah.  and the Jerusalem is created by a silver and gold mirror ball like a black hole.  don't call it a black hole.  let people figure it out by the reflections that move across it.  ok  they make hundreds of millions of new stars and collapse them all into black holes and then sail the fountains to the next galaxy Andromeda.  And then onward out into the galactic filaments before dark energy stops the festival   nano bots   nano bot star makers    enough ( comment:-- ( yyyymmdd:GMTime: 20140302 15:14 ) Ok so F crosses and hearts.  I want the mandelbrot ink blot.  and as you rotate around the ink blot 3D shadows ( like from those plastic 3D effects that they can put onto plastic trading cards that you can hold in your hand that when you rotate them the image changes according to a quantum interference pattern? created by a grating of linear cuts into the plastic like on a vinyl record that project different images according to what angle the light is coming off the grating and going into your eye ) appear briefly a cross and a heart and an anatomically correct heart and a snow flake and a finger print etc.  I want the filaments coming off of the ink blot to be twisted out into 3 dimensions into a systematic tangle that comes outward.  i don't want the actual mandelbrot filaments but something similar.  the ink blot is flat and 2D and rotates so that as you orbit around it it always faces towards you even as the filaments coming out are orbiting in the usual 3D way.  And if you go into the ink blot then what?  you sweep away the stars from the blue thresh hold?  ( bloody heck these frozen let it go gma choralers are nuts everybody wants to be a diva i guess ice ice ice making ice hiding the ice man these people can't sing and that's the point its like singing in tube church way in the black -yay!!! black eyed everybody sing especially the ones who -can't!!! what storm hiding the ice and then abandoning security and letting them know and letting the storm go and making a lot of new ice hmm abandoning hiding the ice and then making a lot of new ice an ice chateau fortress ok it's more like a shack a fonda shak and then she just stops?  She goes into stasis?  cold storage?  we'll get back to you?  just hold on?  what's my motivation!?  ok so i'm just going to sit here and wait.  right.  blllody hell not this again.  wait.  ok i'll wait.  i'll show you waiting.  i'll do the best waiting you ever saw.  my waiting whall bring down the house on the blue threshold.  just you wait.  i don't know but it could be.  my prediction.  haven't seen frozen yet.  no spoilers.  hi kjell she cries    - Oh FK!

There is at least a circular opening above with stars in it.  The center of the earth is not hollow.  The iron core is still down there.  Although a little smaller perhaps than before the builders got to it.  And the godlike being has on a white robe like a wedding dress with a huge long train like 3 miles long.  except it's a male godlike being or maybe you can't really tell for sure.  And maybe 12 or 13 stars hover about his skull or whatever it is s he has.   s He stands up there for a long time in silence.  It's a big cylinder so big that you can't see the edges from the center.  All you can see are some lights on the walls.  which go down in broken tech lines downwards to a point below.  And there aren't really walls because it's just empty space and you can see some of the fake planet sets in there.  fake planet sets the size of the classic earth before the builders ran amok.  And then there is a flash of light like a ring of fire below.  And some time later a huge concussion.  The flash is like the sun or an h bomb.  And then there is a lot of waiting some more.  And eventually we see the dark ringed dot below getting bigger.  Some more waiting.  Biggeer and bigger until we can see it coming.  Rising up.  A huge iron ball.  a thousand miles across rising slowly up until it reaches the pinnacle of its rise at just about eye level.  No it keeps going up above the godlike being.  no there is a slot cut into it into which the godlike being's gantry structure fits as the ball is going up and then he passes out the bottom of the ball.  And then these giant lazer beams come in from all sides and above and below lighting the iron ball up and compressing it into a marble.  1.7 inches across.  this marble has an odd mirror like structure that seems to warp everything that it passes in front of and seems to have no real surface.  This marble slowly descends down to the godlike being.  And then he cups his hand and it stops.  No it slows down but it's still descending.  And then the godlike being whips into a wicked break set and makes all these funny faces and noises.  And then goes silent and stately again.  All the while holding his hand just under the marble.  which is still slowly descending.  he keeps holding it up until it touches his hand and there is a violent white light explosion vaporizing the godlike being but it's okay because on that level there are no individuals.  so it's more like clipping a toe nail.  and the godlike being's fire fly remains zip at the speed of light into an acression disk which shoots out these blue beams above and below the marble.  which continues descending faster and faster.  it keeps going down until there is another bigger blinding white flash from below and a giant blue beam like a giant 3D printer beam that hits a machine floating above with blinking lights and tech baroque and constructs a huge 3D printer which starts printing up more 3D printers which start spinning out the gold and silver spiral space filling mandelbrot like arms of the Jerusalem.  which begins to slowly descend but then it lights up it's million fusion engines on the bottom of the cube 1500 miles per side and the Jerusalem slowly rises up and out into space and hovers there the fusion engines slowly fade to black.  It waits up there for the people and classic animals and plants to board.  Then it collapses the other half of the iron core inside itself into another marble and shoots the small marble at venus.  mercury?  which goes into orbit around venus and starts syphoning gas and dirt and projecting blue beams one towards the Jerusalem and the other in the opposite direction.  And the Jerusalem unfurls giant solar sails and lights up it's million fusion engines again and slowly makes for polaris?  Although at first it looks like it's not moving at all.  Maybe it takes a week to look like it's moving.  And then it folds it's wings back down again and dives for the sun.  Rama like and slingshots around in a tight loop though the corona and back out and back into the blue beam from venus.  And takes off past each planet which crash through its wings which then get rebuilt immediately.  The space filling mandelbrot arms should have an open structure to them that could house living beings and what not.  Like an octopus arm made of open girders so that there are gaps like in a picket fence so you can see though the arms.  filagrees.  the arms keep flaming out into sparks and rebuilding themselves in to different space filling shapes.  different topological architectural experiments.  BIG   .  So if you are living in a house built out of one of the spiral arms gold and silver like glass with black streaks of shade then your house will periodically build itself out bigger and bigger and grander and grander and then erase itself and start over.  These dwelling places are constant being made and destroyed in each and every second during the day.  So you just walk along the path and when you see a place you like you just walk in.  Anything you want.  Just imagine it and up it comes.  Brain scans don't you know.  No it's not the end of history.  The old history is forgotten.  like a dream.  this is where history starts.  maybe.  but what?  think of something.  ok maybe the hangers on out in the drag web still clinging to the old ways of bad keep trying to climb up the web and get into the Jerusalem and cause trouble.  Why?  Who knows.  They can't seem to help it.  They want to turn the whole place dark.  Like a cinder.  To defile it?  To kill it?  Why?  Who knows.  maybe they just like the absence of color ie Black.  they can't sit in an empty room   because if they did they would be torn apart    torn limb from limb.  I don't know.  you make something up.  yeah God is crying.  So when the people of bad get their hands on the brain scanners in the Jerusalem they immediately start turning out weapons of mass destruction and blowing the place up.  But as fast as they blow it up it keeps rebuilding itself.  Which makes them really mad.   i don't know.  something.   and this keeps going on and on in different epochs.  With different flags and different alliances.  And then there is a place(s) down in the core and out on the surface where fighting is not allowed.  the weapons don't work.  And the combatants just stand there and hate each other.  well.   half of them hates the other half.  leave it at that.  comic break.  the justice field.  people trying to whack each other and getting whacked by the field.  No free will.  Ok enough high concept.  I want a low concept character driven stories that take place on the Jerusalem.  These would be broken out into separate low budget films that could all use the common Jerusalem technology at low cost since it would already be installed.  And then I want high concept with synthetic beings being constructed out of gold and silver and shade and given life and souls and given a job to do likety split.  And then what happens to them.  Out in the drag web old space ships are ion driving around just like in a conventional sci fi bar brawl kling on ball buster ride  going from asteroid to asteroid in the net just like they were little planets.  maybe they fight for democrasy?  make up old style governments and argue and kill each other a lot.   just like old times.  In the Jerusalem the various truth futures forms of headless government reign.  everybody can vote just by wishing it.   There is an infinite amount of space and abilities.  not limitless.  after several generations of time all sorts of weird societies of various different technology styles are built and rise and fall in the Jerusalem.   Maybe people carving an old style of life out of different pockets in the Jerusalem.  There are an infinite number of ink blots and each one is an entire universe.  It's a multiverse.  Maybe they could have a Big Bang in one of them.  The Jerusalem has sex with a mortal and BOOM.  How would the Jerusalem manifest herself.  A tall incredibly busty danielle? curvy venus with skin that changes color moment to moment a huge tierra that keeps changing bigger more garish and then smaller more like high and a 3 mile white downed gauzy train with blue bits that has a life of its own that seems to float at times.  and other times hefts back down to earth.  like a tail.  no.  and then she changes by getting squashed and reformed into a funny little girl.  who keeps changing into something else.  I want to dam this mac keyboard make her be on the level of the OS in her.  But even more.  She has all people in herself and so she keeps changing and each character is more intense or even in silence than the last.  She can flick her fingers and throw off sparks that fall to the floor new works of Motzart or Beethoven or Einstein.  There is a lonely left behind boy.  Who knows.  He just can't make it.  I don't know what.  He is cut off.  Maybe he is not cut off.  Maybe he is just jealous of other people getting married and having kids and what not in the tech restricted little world he lives in just off the y77th ink blot on a "solid" spiral arm( solid spiral arms are always made with a kind of picaso light super structure that you can see through but the beams in them can come together to make a solid place to build ).   But he's got something.  A spark.  That other people don't really see.  And the Jerusalem values this spark.  And she manifests herself to him when no one else is looking.  he tries to tell the others no doubt.  to brag.  or something.  but he can't prove it and she won't let him.dam this dm mac keybord     first she manifests herself to him in all her glory.  And then she morphs down into this funny little girl his own age.  who keeps changing into something else.  and he falls in love with her and she opens herself up to him.  and they have sex.  and BOOM the Big Bang.  and he goes down there and finds various worlds and he finds one suspiciously like earth at various moments in history?  and he tries to tell them that he created them but they kick him down the stairs.  don't want to hear it.  or something.  what else what other deviltry       So if you look at the mandelbrot you see that no where in it except for the ink blots is there anything in it that is solid in any way.  Perhaps this could be included in the spiral arms of the Jerusalem?   Perhaps you have to go into one of the ink blots to get to one of these Big Bang universes?  I want characters to be able to live on the spiral arms.  But I also want the spiral arms to be made of nothing.  So you can't live on them.  You can only go into an ink blot.  oh poo.  okay so some of the spiral arms are solid and some of them are made of nothing but froth and ink blots.  I think the froth is an infinite number of ink blots that looks like froth.  Or maybe the ink blots could be like a black surface that you can stand on.  And then you can live on the ink blot by piling dirt onto it and that way you can still see the spiral arms and fly around in the Jerusalem.  Or the ink blot could be like a door.  Some one way and some the other.  Maybe solid spiral arms could sprout up out of the ink blots and people could live on those.  But the other spiral arms the ones made out of ink blot infinity you can never touch.  and these can never be completely destroyed by the hangers on of bad.  the vestigial hunters.  the blood lusters.    the not cyclist not vegans.   maybe sometimes they let the hangers on of bad in just so they have somebody to fight with.  maybe there could be a Jerusalem movie like baraka where nobody fights and there is no conflict at all.

But as the marble comes down the godlike being's mind keeps speeding up faster and faster the closer the marble comes so for s heim it seems to be coming down slower and slower until it seems to stop.  nearly.  to reach out and touch a marble.  also there are vast liquid metal machines floating down in a spherical formation around the marble.  smaller ones in close and massive ones further out in two or more shells.  as the marble falls these machines fall with it.  these machines should be interesting topological architectural artistic embeddings of space.  So you should be able to see through them and see the energy flowing within.  go wild.  get topological.  go architectural.  i don't want to see any flying potatoes.  if i see one more flying potato i will cut my own heart out and swallow it whole and die a thousand deaths and leave you this veil of tiers to defile as you will.  also there are huge topological contraptions orbiting the earth in spherical shells.  maybe some of them look like fermilab.  but liquid metal so they are constantly changing shape.  and you can see the energies flowing within.  so these orbiting machines each one creates a microscopic tiny marble which then eats the machine that creates it and shoots a hypernova beam of blue particles down at the iron ball floating above the godlike being crushing it down into a marble.  some of these beams plow right through the earth so everybody has to be evacuated first except for the godlike being and a few attendants.  the linked battered hollowed earth  is destroyed by the birth of the Jerusalem.  sort of.  it becomes a twisted broken shell.  the Jerusalem creates another marble and sends it to venus.  It goes into orbit around venus.  Now which way is polaris?  Are they going to polaris or somewhere else?  so it is very likely that the marble's blue beam pointed in the direction that the Jerusalem is going to go is going to hit venus during part of the marble's orbit around venus.  and so it is going to cut gashes into venus and throw up a lot of dust and gas which the marble will suck up and turn into a stream of light speed particles pointed at the Jerusalem's solar sails.  after a few thousand years or something there will be nothing left of venus and the marble will keep orbiting the sun in venus's orbit.  the star of the morning will be gone.  The venus marble will also have an entourage of liquid metal machines with visible energy beams flowing around inside of them.  And some will orbit venus pacing the marble and some will stay geosynchronous to venus.  Let's get all 2001 upside the public ass man.   maybe it's not possible anymore.  people's attention spans have been reduced by incessant electronic novelty to the point of non existence.  that's why i don't want any mr potato head ships.  liquid metal but not smooth and shiny.  they can have rough edges and the usual techno baroque but they have to keep changing and pulsing and rewriting themselves.  and you have to see the energies sitting in the different parts of them and see that energy come out and be directed to other areas of the machine to generate different effects.  we should be able to watch the machines preparing themselves to do different things.  also there should be lots of little machines running on and flying around the larger ones.  like the liquid metal computer monitors in the latest superman movie.  the orbiting machines should be able to morph like that.  and be able to split up into different pieces and re-hook up into different configurations ) )

He was standing part on the ink blot and part off.  and jumps away towards the center of the ink blot and away from the foam that attaches to the edge of the ink blot they are standing on.  and kiev yells out : Well How are we supposed to get off of here?  each ink blot has it's own gravity.  janis says : step lightly.  and xenon says : we fly.  and he imagines a vehicle like a boat.  Once they get away from the ink blot then they float free.  If kiev stepped off the ink blot then he would shrink down and land on one of the microscopic ink blots in the ink blot foam he was stepping onto.  and be lost forever.  until Jerusalem could find him again which might not be possible if he shrank down below her maximum level of microscopic resolution.  or she could send in a lot of robot scouts in after him to increase the scan resolutions.  the Jerusalem is new so everybody who hasn't assimilated the manuals like kiev since he is a classic human and can't assimilate.  so they have to be careful not to run into any of the foam spiral arms because as they get closer and closer they shrink down and shrink down until they land on or in a mandelbrot ink blot embedded in the ink blot fractal foam.  it's all very high concept.  so how do i clear away all the high concept stuff and get character driven.  how do i get all the technology to fade into the background and just focus on two people in the Jerusalem.  And their day to day lives.  Which technology level.  What do people do in the Jerusalem.  What society.  What organization.  what collectives.  i want to focus here on a small set of characters in like a romance or something.  just on their interactions and the technology of the Jerusalem interacts with them in the back ground.  I don't really know how to make such a story.  dialog.  alls i get are dialog fragments.  like poetry.  disconnected.  can anyone behave badly on the Jerusalem.  do i need that?  somebody in danger of getting kicked off the Jerusalem.  out into the drag web.  thought police with brain scanners that can read your mind.  Jerusalem is reading your mind and she is judging you.  if you get too far off the rails for more than 7 times 77 times then you're out.  what if somebody starts getting near that limit.  there could be a little girl out on the drag web who dreams of living on the Jerusalem.  No doubt that would be near automatic but i could put up a bunch of road blocks.  maybe the road blocks are character building.  but she doesn't know that.  maybe she has to break with her parents and her clan to do that.  can i take a character driven story that already exists and graft it onto the Jerusalem?  no action.  all high concepts are in he back ground.  perhaps it is the end of history if you can have anything you want just by wishing for it.  forbidden planet?  could people incorporate rapid fire wishing into their relations with each other?  some of these foreign films don't have any evil characters in them like the japanese film about the woman and her cats.  good and evil?  Jerusalem and the drag web?  what happens to society when everybody can have everything they wish for?  up to some large limit?  you have to have people who are evil to a degree that is below some maximum level.  or else people start wishing up weapons of mass destruction.  that is what hell is a set of relatively evil people with infinite abilities like red angels stuck together in a lake.  maybe.  somebody gets the idea of lighting the lake on fire and up she goes.  maybe.  there could be an amish like story but at a higher technology level.  where some of the kids want to move up to a higher level and the local church tries to stop it.  perhaps getting everything you wish for is something that is really hard to handle for certain minds.  if there are no restrictions no boundaries maybe only the trained minds like the monks and the amish can really handle it.  or will people just get bored with everything and go into a coma.  or will all the people who see this movie feel that way probably unable to live on the Jerusalem themselves?  nothing but walking twitch reflexes and lizard brains?  hmm.  low budget Jerusalem movies about girls with cats.  a low budget Jerusalem movie about a girl and her cats with the Jerusalem rising up on all sides in the sky.  could that go?  a traditional classic now japanese city in the Jerusalem?  why wouldn't she just fly away?  like the amish were afraid of when the automobile came on the scene?  why wouldn't she just fly away and wander aimlessly?  she would have to look at the Jerusalem up in the sky and consciously decide not to go there.  Or a big high power plasma video screen could fake the classic sky including the heat of the sun.  sprinklers for rain.  and then the Jerusalem would just vanish.  what would being on the Jerusalem do to people's minds.  do they need to have certain restrictions or they just blow apart?  could be.  it seems to happen to the rich i have heard.  perhaps people would engage in minute interactions of a subtle nature that wouldn't work in a film.  in a film that was trying to make money.  if you don't care about making money...  could you make a film about somebodies electronic interactions?  you've got mail?  boy meets Jerusalem boy loses Jerusalem boy goes on a quest to get Jerusalem back boy wins Jerusalem boy marries Jerusalem boy finds out Jerusalem is married to 500K other guys.  And 100K other women too.  But that's okay because Jerusalem can be in 600K different places all at once.  Still.  He gets jealous.   if nothing bad ever happens to anybody will all the stories be girl cat stories?  could i make it blatant Christian.  Christian Science fiction?  That would get around the lizard brain and twitch response problems with trying to appeal to the usual semi secular semi atheist semi pagan all consumer tv baked basically semi evil sadd audiences.  Yeah, i could make it blatant Christian.  maybe.  maybe i should look at some christian Science fiction,  could it make enough money to go.  maybe the animators could make everything in a couple weeks because it's all simple stuff anyway and it wouldn't cost that much.  want reality.  but Troll did pretty good with not much money.    what airy day dreams.  enough. ) )

( from now on we see the dot close up through jaycob's eyes we see it through his eyes ) and he looks at it slowly glowing in front of him.  his expression goes a little slack as he looks into it.  suddenly the 4 on the cushions near jerusalem perk up.  they look at jerusalem intently focused total on jaycob.  they look at jaycob.  they're expressions go slack and then begin to alarm.  they start to rise up from the cushions.  they start yelling.  half at jaycob and half at jerusalem.  and their arms begin to stretch out in both directions.  jaycob doesn't seem to hear them.  they try to rush jaycob but somehow they don't get up.  then they roll over stretched out on the cushions towards jerusalem and stretch their arms out straight towards her with the fingers apart straining like lining up an assault blaster.  and lightning comes out of their fingertips and blows jerusalem's skin off.  she glances at them and her skin grows back and she continues to look at jaycob who is still fixated on the dot.  more lightning and her skin blows off again and near instantly grows back.  she remains calm.  focused.  they set to with more murderous intent and her skin blows off and grows back faster and faster.  jaycob slowly begins to lift his left arm up towards the dot.  jerusalem seems to be in a strobe light of skin flying everywhere.  unmoved.  unblinking to jaycob.  one of the guys sees jaycob slowly raising up his arm and yells at him and breaks off and the strobe slows down a little.  the arm in the forground the guy out of focus into focus in the background on the cushions.  his left index finger begins to extend as his arm comes slowly up.  it bends back and buffets a little as it hits the shell of air.  and then it presses through.  we see jerusalem's eyes filling the screen the skin around them strobing quickly.  each strobe shows the muscles and bones beneath.  going faster and faster into a blur.  the eyes are very beautiful like gaga without makeup when they are skinned and like billiard balls when their ice is broken.  his finger comes up to the dot slower and slower.  the guy facing jaycob yells NOOOO and breaks off his attack and makes a herculean effort to get up off the couch and makes it miraculous and rushes towards him like an defensive line backer.  the dot melts into his finger like a snow flake and the glow sinks down into his skin on the finger print and sinks down into his finger like a glowing flare sinks down into the sea.  jerusalem slowly closes her eyes and begins to fade.  and then her body explodes splattering all over the walls.  the line backer in slow motion hits jaycob in the mid rift and knocks him back into fast motion and they go flying and hit the floor some meters back towards the grand staircase.  and jaycob yells hey!!! and struggles and grabs the arms around him and twists and wrestles them off and rolls over and flips the line backer off and jumps to his feet into a stance and ready to fight.  What the HELL are you doing?  and he looks into his left palm  and he looks around the room.  and he wonders where jerusalem went and he recognizes her and he brings his index finger back up and looks at the spot where the dot went in.  and jaycob says : hey what is this stuff.  i don't feel a thing.  jerusalem's remains squidge together like high speed wriggling worm pieces and pile onto each other and pile up into a small monster of flesh which parts up at the top into a wide mouth like opening pointing up to the high ceiling which opens and slobbers gaga gutteral modified like the robot in alien : wait for it ... topological curvature.  and then the mouth collapses under a rain of lightning that splatters it all over the walls again.  jaycob says : topological curvature?  with his face all incredulous still looking at the spot.  the others are all looking at him all of them on deck now and ready for action.  then his face goes slack.  and he looks up out beyond the walls.  and he says : oh my god ...

( AStoryIdea-named:copyrightBy:startedOnDate:atGMTime:ideas:-- ( just talk science fiction movie )( copyright kjell e godø )( 20140422 yyyymmdd )( 17:27 Seattle )( wild architecture several light years high and continually doing advanced topological things to space and time is going off throughout this movie  It is a travel movie so there is constant motion  It may start on a planet in one of the thumb print universes in the Jerusalem  And then it goes out into the Jerusalem but it is a strange Jerusalem They seem to land in a city several times with the architecture getting wilder and bigger expanding out into space and doing weirder and weirder things to them as they keep going There is gravity but the masses seemingly floating up there whole landscapes curving around and defying Get some topologists to help Use the alpha to glass Some times they are out in the country but the country is winding up into the sky And flat does not describe what is going on at all It is a new married couple doing the traveling But they seem to pass through all different ages from one hour to the next  They never explain this  As they keep going friends join up with them and then depart again A cloud of them are in similar motion and they touch each other as they keep going along There is some kind of media that they use to talk Maybe it becomes clear that their speech patterns are steganographic with everything having at least two meanings a light and a dark and some others And they just keep going Like a French movie But the science fiction just keeps getting more and more intense but each new thing that would normally fill it's own movie just comes and then goes again And these things keep piling up and piling up through wilder and wilder architectures If these architectures are the sonnets then Syd Mead is the letter $a ( no offense Syd Mead is the top but i want to go way way beyond his this And i want him to do it He is the top ) The couple just take every new thing in stride There happen to be several copies of themselves that they keep slipping back into when they get close enough to to a thumb print to pick up the subspace signal or other It's not dark It's not dark But now and then and more and more towards the end they keep running into things that are too much for them and they wind up rebelling against them and regrouping back to the good old days which to the audience looks like the far distant future So there isn't a big conflict I don't think The characters just talk So it's like a play But the architecture keeps changing and this keeps a continually advancing sense of wonder building Like Alice in wonderland Maybe there is a brief out and out conflict at the end but we see that it is the technology interacting with them and how it makes them behave towards each other that is the key maybe they decide just to shut it all down and live in a cabin on a new thumb print they create then and there and then dive into and then it goes on some more for a while the terminator is not dead And then they wind up asleep on the beach in some beach chairs all three or four of them  and the sun is either coming I think the sun is coming up But I don't mean anything by it It's just a star rising above the horizon on the planet they are on So no big concepts No aliens or technologies trying to blow up the world yet again that have to be killed off before the end It's just two people or sets trying to work it out Oscar ? Perhaps it would prove that the only way a science fiction movie is ever going to win it is you have to take all the action out How about she is way more powerful than him and this makes him insecure but he keeps kissing her all the time in public and it's okay in the end He has no power His macho just falls flat and this is very troubling But it's okay because she's Jewish Italian and if he tried to put that one over on her anyway it would set off a Herculean struggle for exactly who is going to wear the dresses in the house like Sher and Sonny he just doesn't get it and she just doesn't get it either the whole key to the problem is that she is the one wearing the dresses all the time and That Has Got To Stop So boy loses girl and then lets her go briefly not too long and then he quickly realizes what is happening that she is slipping away well that part of it anyway and he chases her and keeps going breaking down barrier after barrier inside of himself until he finally wins her back shucks it all off all the hot late 20 somethings he was fighting off with his barrette spawns a copy to take care of that and rejoins up with her vowing revowing and he gives up his striving to be over top of her and suddenly finally if clicks in her and it all comes flooding back and makes sense in a moment not too late An his copy gets busy with th late 20 somethings And what does he have to die then? No A symbolic death Or one of his copies shows up to take his place No deaths Symbolic only So it's a Sher and sonny or Gaga and gighter no violence no save the world in the knick of time lots more science than usual but it's everyday science as they use it and it affects them in daily life and lots more architecture and lots of topology and lots of movement as they keep traveling but no shooting no ducking for cover no explosions unless it is to regroup from a stinging retort And perhaps they have powers to shape matter at will and these forces we see them use both consciously and unconsciously in their conversations most people talk with their hands but this couple talk with all the matter and space and energy around them We see it manifest in the air around them and we get it before they do We see the subconscious threads they don't seem to Perhaps the subconscious stuff happens behind walls that they can't see but we do Also the architecture of space and time should mirror and describe what is going on between them But with counter points to mess up the waves Maybe there is this other guy competing who realizes he doesn't really care about her anymore but is actually more involved with him from a revenge angle he has fallen in love with him and his downfall and she is just a means to that end even if he wanted to stop the madness he can't because of everyone egging him on in his sect Or something Cross currents and noise Maybe after all he winds up using the guy for good his own good and redirects the sect into other bigger things  Maybe he gets captured and the video links and playbacks start rolling showing him how far is the fall and catching him up on everything he missed but it's only a copy and the copy somehow gets loose and all hell breaks loose  Water tight doors have to be put into use  And minions cut off  which doesn't happy the other minions too much  Before it all gets tamped down And the losses tallied  Steganographic under currents  Multiple channels at once overt and not hidden but hidden to them but not to us It solves the problem of talk movies not moving enough It has lots of science going off louder and louder but no violence and no deaths Threats But no deaths Comedy Romance Drama Science fiction And Atheist and NonAtheist Religion And the battle of the sexes And an Edgar revenge subplot or three Maybe it should come in two 3 hour parts that open one right after the other Why not Just shoot them both and There must be a reason why it is never done this way But from here I can't see it Maybe the Sonny character knows he is being watched by the sect all the time but the Sher doesn't and can't because it is against her religion so everything he says is meant for both of them at the same time And it turns out that they are just a show on some network somewhere or other but she doesn't know it and he doesn't know just how big the show is But the show hides it And then it turns out it was just a little show But then it gets revealed even bigger again It keeps switching So all of this is going on at the same time as they are having it out And going from one end of time and space and technology to the other Once the Jerusalem is set up then you can use it over and over again for stuff like this )

( AStoryIdea-named:copyrightBy:startedOnDate:atGMTime:idea: ( water girl )( copyright kjell e godø )( 20140507 yyyymmdd )( 7:10 Seattle )( I probably shouldn't have deleted the water girl idea from yesterday.  But when I start snowing myself and I can't stop it I just want to delete it.  So I did.  Maybe I can recreate it better.  here later.
Sometimes I know it's all just a big shaving cream con heart bleeding out of a card dripping from a pen of casino suits and these are all just actors.  in my head.  if they were real I would be scitzophrenic by now.  I would be gone.  but they never seem to actually get here.  sometimes I think they are benevolent.  and if I knew that they were a fraud.  we'll.  maybe I would go along with it anyway.  I like the side effects.  today.  they are just actors in a dream.  I think I can control them.  they don't look evil to me.  the evil is walled off today.  and if I can wrap this up now that will actually be true.  if I can't then it is controlling me and I don't like that.  but I am a Boy Scout and that means I have to know all the possibilities I can know and lean as fast as I can into the one that seems to be happening now.  and always trying to be ready to deflect a 180.  so all you have to do is play the actor.  and you will be safe.  but if you come too close to where if you were lying I would be dead then I don't like that.  because I don't believe you.  but I'm willing to go along with it up to a point.  then the ball is in your court.  and I'm waiting for your serve.  and I am trying to be ready for anything.  and if anything is coming too close then I will act. ) )
( AStoryIdea-named:copyrightBy:startedOnDate:atGMTime:idea: ( green girl )( copyright kjell e godø )( 20140507 yyyymmdd )( 7:36 Seattle )( that wasn't too bad.  times up.  the green haired girl is fascinating.  she doesn't look angry but her eyes are filled with 6 lights of s.  but divided up into 2 sets of trinity.  either she is sick to her stomach or she is green with envy.  I think it is sick.  she looks rye.  she has these black lines in her face.  three black lines so that's another trinity.  I don't know what they are.  maybe plastic explosives.  in the shape of goggles or boobs.  boobs are in the eyes of the beholder.  like : hey my stomach is as flat as my chest is what do you want.  silly cone?  no.  I don't much like silly cone.  I like real fat.  but if it's not there then it's not there.  maybe she's some kind of Jane air type like my girl.  her body is holy when it comes to knives and besides the expense is a blast pheme and she doesn't care about and can't conceive what she might benefit if she was to relent.  she can't know what would really happen.  "but it's not real"  oh b last.  of course it's not real you idiot.  but it doesn't matter.  I know from years decades of daily day by day hour by hour minute by minute experience that IT DOESNT MATTER.  IF YOU ONLY REALIZE ONE TRUTH IN THIS LIFE THAT YOU DIDNT ALREADY KNOW LET IT BE THIS : IT DOESNT MATTER.  IT DOESNT MATTER.  IT DOESNT MATTER.  when those curves of a perfect cleavage hit my brain it doesn't matter if they are two dimensional scrawls on a crumpled out scarp of legal pad.  my brain lights up like a Christmas tree and then bursts into flame.  it's a fetish.  that's all there is to it.  I don't much like frontal.  it has to be pushed together and up.  and overflow out the sides.  and it has to cleave.  it's very specific.  it knows what it wants.  it knows what receptors it has got.  up the yin yang.  in spades.  and all the ones that it doesn't.  got.  and never ever has.  got.  but if you.  yeah?  I'm old enough to be her father no matter how old she is so this is just a rift in a day dream of what if.  but if she would just relent.  and no. there is no way I could get her to buy it.  dam.  oh crap.  I think she's got it but I just couldn't sell it.  she would just cut me off and there would be no way in.  after.  but I'm telling you I would n't be able to keep my eyes or my hands off her.  but she just can't conceive what that would mean.  it might change everything.  if only.  she would relent.  oh but it's impossible.  hopeless.  how could I make her see.  it's a fetish damm it.  why not use it?  I do.  every dog blammed day.  and that is what you are missing out on.  think about it.  try to imagine.  every day I imagine you like I want you and you get none of it.  every day.  sometimes two or three times a day.  my brain is getting it but not you.  if only you knew.  so pitiful.  standing on to the virgin Klondike mother of all gold rushes and you have been for years and you don't even know it.  pouncing around like you know what is going on when it's all just being wasted.  has been wasted.  so bad for so long.  it just staggers the imagination.  what could have been.  "I don't care."    fuck. ) )

I will divorce you on the spot.  take everything you got.  and leave you spare.  raise an army and come back here and waste this entire country down to the pebble s lying on the ground here.  just like I have been wasted all these years.  except for real.  be on time and we're good.  be late.  and this whole country goes up in flames.  no exceptions no matter.  so what do you say.  pull lease?  pretty pull lease with whip cream on top?

( in Norway i got hip butted by a girl in Horten i think.  then i tried to asks her to dance but she instantly said no vehemently.  which crushed me.  because I ok have it your way I knew I couldn't talk to her.  I think now that she wanted me to push harder.   maybe.  probably.  she was a player anyway.  just serialising.  at the end of the night as we were all waiting to leave she across looked at her friend to the right of me and looked at me and shrugged her shoulders.  just a tad disappointed.  well what the hell am I supposed to do.  I remember thinking it but in a vague unformed fog of younger.  I can't speak to you.  if I open my mouth the pedantics will start flowing out.  the too polite to mount any offensive that might work pedants.  so I was stuck.  again.  forever.  fabulous sweet whipped creamed Sunday cherry right in front of my nose and I have no tongue to reach out a lick.  just out of.  so I just stood there on the other side of the covered walk stone arch drive way thing in the disco tech looking every now and to her then my thigh still soar from where she let me have it.  wow she nearly broke my leg.  it felt like.  sort of.  ok if I knew what having a broken leg was really like I probably wouldn't mention that but it still hurt hours later.  she really let me have it.  I was just standing there leaning on the wood looking down at the people dancing right along with everybody else up there and POW.  WHAT?!!  omg     THAT HURTtt     nothing     a few minutes later they both walk   I find her again     I ask    she says no with a little well practiced cut to it looking me right in the eye looking into me assessing me in an instant      then turning back    cutting me off over and out      huffing?     waiting?     I can't remember    no huffing   no   she was too strong and cool to ever huff  etc ) Kiev: ok     aurora : you think your going to cut me?   what about you?   what are you going to cut?   Kiev : hey.

( AStoryIdea-named:copyrightBy:startedOnDate:atGMTime:idea: ( fetish integration into Jerusalem )( copyright kjell e godø )( 20140509 yyyymmdd )( 7:44 Seattle )( rough idea probably won't hold up but here goes
ok so aurora is this sadist super princess queen of a host of two faced sad it's minions
Kiev stop that whatever Kiev is the head of an angel army smaller than hers fighting her every day tooth and nail with explosions and car chases and fingers flying the whole entire catastrophe
but every day when the sun rises above the horizon they meet on neutral ground in a her outlying towering Venetian 360 castle black
and go crazy
just total bonkers
and he just can't stop because she has got him right in by the fetish is
she had it constructed special
and he just can't leave her alone
but he keeps trying
but she won't budge
he keeps trying to get her to soften her DNA
but she dials it more sad it's so
blast it he gets all worked up
but she won't change
just an eight of an inch
come on
what would I hurt
just an eighth
no
ok eventually she is alone having killed thousands of greens that day
just sitting there
and she does dial it on eighth of an inch towards him
and eventually she dials it all the way and becomes angel
but she never lets him know that
she starts faking the killings
using actors and video
and he is fighting her day after day harder and harder but she doesn't seem to notice
and that is somewhat disappointing 
eventually he sees a tiny clue
and the whole thing unravels in his head
and he knows she is shamming him and has been for a long time
but he only pauses
and every her orgasm she screams bloody murder and whips off her wig
and he kisses the lemon spiked nipple painted there each day
and then kisses her and she tastes the lemon
Kiev : why don't you just grow hair why don't you just mod your DNA?
no
aurora : you want hair ?
Kiev : no
you know I don't notice what is on top of your head I never get up that far
I like a different hair each day anyway
aurora : then stop
day break
he is waiting looking way down and out and shielding a hand
a rustle
another new dress to try out
zow
she likes to hit him right where it hurts
and he bursts into flame
every single time
and she says : why don't You Mod YOUR DNA
you keep complaining how inconvenient It all am
how you never get any work done anymore
Why Don't You just relax
Kiev : at least I don't have to hurt any one
except you
aurora : speak for yourself or back at you ok fix this this stinks I can't say this
so eventually she sees a tiny clue and realises that he knows that she is shamming him
and he has known for a long time
and this entire war was just for show
but she only pauses
and eventually they are like two actors playing different parts
with different crews
and she plays an angel 
and then shyly looks at him
playing
and he plays an devil right back at you

Please Please Please Please Please Please publish to iTunes your original song called 
"The Sky Was The Limit" 
this song is one of my top 5 favorite songs of all time.  I have listened to this song 266 times.  It is the one song of yours that I never get tired of so far.  I would gladly take it with me if I had to die on a desert island and I could only bring one song. I will buy any album on iTunes that has this song in it.  I will buy it Twice.  I would like to use this song in the open source movie script cloud called Jerusalem I'm working on at  
https://www.icloud.com/iw/#pages/BAKLw-zh-8gq98-y8AeBvOR_m1OheDji7dKE/Jerusalem_Changes
Which you are welcome to edit.
At 
https://www.icloud.com/iw/#pages/BAIW1Joa0DKVVYeiTSaBGChsP9PyqGCTgiKF/Jerusalem_Merges
which is not editable is where the changes in the editable version can be merged and backed up
if I ever get that far.  I want the Jerusalem characters to play a modified version of this song when they are being chased off the end of the world they are on and at maybe two other places in one or more of the movies.  It's just ideas yet.  Take a look at Jerusalem if you have nothing better to do sometime and leave a comment in the editable version( there are instructions up at the top of the file ).  I was thinking the sound track for the episode that uses this song could just be what the characters are listening to at that moment on screen.  And The Sky Was The Limit was one of the songs they listen to.  I'm nobody.  And everything I write is crap.  Thank you for making this song. It's not. )
